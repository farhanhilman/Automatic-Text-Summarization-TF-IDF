"On 22 July 2019, a Cessna 172S registered PK-WUG was being operated by Angkasa
Aviation Academy (AAA) on a mutual flight training exercise from Cakrabhuwana Airport 
(WICD), Cirebon to Indramayu Training Area. The flight plan was filed with cruising altitude 
of 2,000 feet. The exercise for the student pilot was on C-14 Stage which contained exercises 
of mutual precision rate one turns, compass error and performance maneuvers.
Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction. On board 
the aircraft were two student pilots and one of the students acted as Pilot in Command (PIC)
while the other student pilot seated on the right seat. 
At 1358 LT, the PK-WUG aircraft departed from Cirebon to the Indramayu Training Area. 
The Global Positioning System (GPS) installed in the aircraft recorded that when the aircraft 
was flying over the southern boundary of the Indramayu Training Area, the aircraft was 
descending. At 1425 LT, the aircraft flew westerly and was descending passed 750 feet.
The aircraft continued descend and while flew over the Cimanuk River passed 140 feet. 
About one minute flying over the river, the aircraft struck power line cables and crashed into
the river.
After the aircraft stopped, both pilots self-evacuated from the aircraft and helped by local 
people to the river bank. During the evacuation, the Safety Pilot was drowned and fatally 
injured while the PIC had minor injury. 
The investigation determined that the aircraft serviceability was not issue in this accident. The 
investigation concluded the contributing factor of the accident was: 
The available means to monitor flight training activities that had not been utilized 
resulted in the aircraft flying below the minimum safe altitude was undetected.
Flying the aircraft below the minimum safe altitude and unaware of the power line cables 
ran across the river made the aircraft struck three power line cables.

"On 25 May 2019, an Airbus A320 aircraft registered PK-LZJ was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport (WAAA), Makassar 
to Mopah International Airport (WAKK), Merauke. On board the aircraft was two pilots, five 
flight attendants and 82 passengers. 
At 1842 UTC (0242 LT), on night time, the aircraft commenced pushback from stand B1. The 
push back operation used towing tractor with the three crews consisted of towing tractor 
driver, a wing-man and a headset-man who performed by an aircraft mechanic. There was no 
briefing among the crew related to the pushback activity including the push back maneuver. 
The towing tractor driver and wing-man used high visibility vest while the headset-man used 
company uniform without any fluorescence strip or high visibility vest. 
The push back maneuver did not follow the guideline and the headset-man walked behind the 
nose wheel while observing the engine start process. During a turn, the aircraft nose wheel 
passed over the right foot of the headset-man. The towing tractor driver felt a bump and 
noticed that the headset-man laid on the ground. The headset-man evacuated to the nearest 
hospital for medical treatment and found sustaining fracture on his right tarsometatarsal.
The investigation determined that the aircraft and towing tractor airworthiness serviceability, 
and communication transmission were not an issue on this occurrence. Therefore, the analysis 
discussed the pushback operation and personnel awareness. The investigation concluded the 
contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:
The different assumption of pushback maneuver between headset-man and the push back 
tractor driver, and both were fixated to their own duties while working on a reduced 
alertness condition, resulted in the towing tractor driver did not aware of the headset-man 
position and the headset-man did not aware of the nose wheel position. These conditions led 
to the nose wheel passed over the headset-man foot.
The KNKT had been informed of safety actions taken by the involved parties resulting from 
this occurrence. However, there still remain safety issues that need to be considered. 
Therefore, the KNKT issues the following safety recommendations addressed to the Angkasa

"On 11 August 2018, a PAC 750XL aircraft registered PK-HVQ was being operated by PT. 
Marta Buana Abadi (Dimonim Air) on unscheduled passenger flight from Tanah Merah to 
Oksibil. At the day of the occurrence the meteorological condition at Oksibil was below the 
requirement of Visual Flight Rule (VFR) weather minima and did not improve. Being aware 
that some flights had performed flight to Tanah Merah to Oksibil and returned, the pilot 
decided to fly to Oksibil. 
At 1342 LT, on daylight condition the PK-HVQ aircraft departed from Tanah Merah to 
Oksibil, on board the aircraft were one pilot, one observer pilot and 7 passengers. According 
to the passenger and cargo manifest, the total weight of passenger and the baggage were 473 
kg. Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction.
At 1411 LT, the PK-HVQ pilot made initial contact to Oksibil Tower controller and reported 
that the aircraft was maintaining altitude of 7,000 feet over and the estimate time arrival at 
Oksibil would be 0520 UTC (1420 LT). The Oksibil Tower controller advised the pilot of the 
latest meteorological condition that the visibility was 1 up to 2 km and most of the area were 
covered by cloud.
At 1416 LT, the pilot reported that the aircraft position was over Oksibil Aiport and the 
Oksibil Tower controller instructed the pilot to continue the flight to the final runway 11 and 
to report when the runway had in sight.
The Oksibil Tower controller and pilots of other aircraft called the pilot but no reply. On the 
following day, the aircraft was found on a ridge of mountain about 3.8 Nm north west of 
Oksibil on bearing 331Â° with elevation about 6,800 feet. Eight occupants were fatally injured 
and one occupant was seriously injured. 
Investigation involved Transport Accident Investigation Commission of New Zealand and 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada that assigned accredited representative according to 
the ICAO Annex 13.
The investigation determined the contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:
VFR weather minimum requirement that was not implemented properly most likely had 
made the pilot did not have a clear visual to the surrounding area. 
Considering that the Pilot in Command (PIC) had lack knowledge of the terrain 
surrounding the Oksibil area, and the absence of voice alert from the TAWS when the 
aircraft flying close to terrain, resulted in the PIC did not have adequate awareness to the 
surrounding terrain while flying into clouds and continued to fly below the terrain height 
until the aircraft impacted the terrain.
The KNKT acknowledged the safety action taken by the related parties and considered the 
actions were relevant to improve safety, however, there still remain safety issues that need to 
be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations addressed to the

At about 29 Nm from Oksibil, the PK-FSO aircraft passed a Cessna 208B aircraft which was 
flying on opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanah Merah at altitude 6,000 feet. The Cessna 
208B pilot advised to the pilot on radio frequency 122.7 MHz that the PK-FSO aircraft was in 
sight. The pilot responded that the aircraft was maintaining 7,000 feet on direct route to 
Oksibil.
At 1240 LT, the Oksibil tower controller received another phone call from the FlyingSAS 
officer at Jakarta which informed that the FlyingSAS flight following system received SOS 
signal (emergency signal)from PK-FSO aircraft which located approximately 6 Nm north of 
Oksibil. Afterwards, the Oksibil air traffic controller advised the occurrence to the Search and 
Rescue Agency.
On 13 April 2017, at 2211 UTC, the PK-FSO aircraft was found on ridge of Anem Mountain 
which located about 7 Nm north of Oksibil. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and 
the pilot was fatally injured. 
The investigation determined that the aircraft serviceability was not issue in this occurrence. 
Therefore, the analysis discussed the aircraft flight profile; pilot medical condition and 
activities; organization oversight; and pilot medical examination. The investigation concluded 
the contributing factor of the accident was the possibility of the pilot being fatigue, physical 
and environment condition increased pilot sleepiness which might have made the pilot 
inadvertently falling asleep indicated by no pilot activity. The absence of GA-EGPWS aural 
alert and warning was unable to wake up the pilot.
The KNKT has been informed safety actions taken by the FlyingSAS and Balai Kesehatan

Flight Academy on a solo flight training area from Blimbingsari Airport (WADY), 
Banyuwangi to Panggang Bay training area and return to Blimbingsari. 
After returned from the area up to the final approach runway 08, the approach was normal 
refer to the training provided and the student pilot requested for full stop landing.
At 0317 UTC, before touchdown the student pilot flared out and the aircraft ballooning.
The student pilot pushed the control column slightly. The aircraft nose down and the 
propeller hit the runway. The student pilot action to recover the ballooning was contrary to 
the ballooning recovery technique according to the Airplane Flying Handbook.
The aircraft stopped and fire appeared on the front right side of the aircraft. The student 
pilot evacuated through the left door. 
The wreckage examination found fuel line broken on the right lower fuselage that most 
likely caused by the impact. The fuel spill from the broken fuel line and the spark that 
possibly created by the friction of the aircraft part with the runway ignited the fire.
The controller saw the condition and notified the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting 
Services (ARFF) by activating the serine and the crash bell. The fire extinguished after 
about 20 minutes and two foam tenders used more than 6,500 liters water and mixed with

"On 25 December 2016, an ATR 72-600 aircraft registered PK-WGW was being operated by 
PT. Wings Abadi Airlines (Wings Air) as a scheduled passenger flight from Husein 
Sastranegara International Airport (WICC), Bandung to Ahmad Yani International Airport 
(WAHS), Semarang with flight number WON 1896. On board the aircraft were two pilots, 
two flight attendants and 68 passengers. There was no report or record of aircraft system 
malfunction prior to the departure.
At 1734 LT (1034 UTC), the aircraft departed from Bandung. The Pilot in Command (PIC) 
acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM).
The flight from departure until commencing for landing approach was uneventful. 
At 1121 UTC, the tower controller had visual contact to the aircraft and issued landing 
clearance, the pilot acknowledged the clearance and requested to reduce the approach light 
intensity. The tower controller reduced the light intensity and confirmed whether the intensity 
was appropriate then the pilot affirmed.
At 1124 UTC, the aircraft touched down and bounced. After the third bounce, the pilot 
attempted to go around and the aircraft touched the runway. 
The tower controller realized that the aircraft was not in normal condition and pressed the 
crass bell then informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) personnel by phone 
that there was aircraft accident near the taxiway D. While waiting the assistance, the pilot kept 
the engines run to provide lighting in the cabin.
At 1129 UTC, the tower controller advised the pilot to shut down the engines since the ARFF 
personnel had arrived near the aircraft to assist the evacuation. Passenger evacuation 
completed at approximately 10 minutes after the aircraft stopped. 
No one injured in this accident and the aircraft was substantially damaged. The right main 
landing gear folded inward and the propellers tip of the engine number 2 broken at about 26 
cm from the tip. On the right fuselage of the aircraft, found several dents and punctures.
The investigation determined that the aircraft serviceability was not issue in this occurrence. 
Therefore, the analysis discussed the bounce landing, visual illusion and emergency 
procedure. The investigation concluded the contributing factor of the accident was:
ï‚· The visual illusion of aircraft higher than the real altitude resulted in late flare out which 
made the aircraft bounced.
ï‚· The unrecovered bounce resulted in abnormal landing attitude with vertical acceleration 
up to 6 g and collapsed the right main landing gear.

"The Piper PA28-161 Warrior II, registration PK-PBH on 19 October 2016 was being operated 
by Perkasa Flying School on a dual flight training touch and go exercise in Tunggul Wulung 
Airport (WAHL) Cilacap, Indonesia.
Several days before the accident the student pilot had injured to left hand wrist and the student 
pilot did not report the injury to the flying school nor the flight instructor. The â€˜Internal 
Cockpitâ€™ checklist, the pilot required to ensure the fuel selector valve was selected to the Left 
Tank. Subsequently, the â€˜Before Take-offâ€™ checklist required the pilots to move the fuel 
selector to the Right Tank. The injury impaired the ability to operate the fuel selector as 
required by the checklist.
At 0030 UTC (0730 LT), the student pilot conducted pre-flight check to the aircraft. The 
student pilot stated that the aircraft was normal and the fuel uplifted was about 190 litres. 
At 0831 LT, the aircraft was lining-up and took off from runway 31. After the aircraft 
airborne, about 300 feet the instructor pilot noticed the engine sound was spooling down. The 
instructor pilot advanced the throttle to increase the engine power however, the engine RPM 
did not increase. Thereafter, the instructor pilot also reached the fuel selector valve with the 
intention to change the fuel selector valve position but the engine RPM continued spooling 
down and the engine quit.
The instructor pilot decided to conduct the force landing on an open area. The instructor pilot 
took the aircraft control and declared mayday due to engine quit with the intention to make 
emergency landing. The controller noticed the aircraft turn right until disappeared behind the 
trees. During descend to the open area, the instructor pilot attempted to restart the engine
without success.
The aircraft landed on paddy field about 1.3 Nm from the beginning of runway 31, on the 
north of the airport. Both pilots survived and self-evacuated the aircraft. The aircraft was 
substantially damage.
The engine ground run test found that if the selection of fuel selector performed more than 3 
seconds after the engine hesitation, the engine would remain hesitation and quit because of the 
engine has been decelerating significantly and the engine unable to suck the fuel from the 
carburettor. The engine ground run test also found that after the fuel in the engine fuel line 
system was exhausted, the engine restart attempt would be success after minimum of 5 restart 
attempts.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors in this occurrence are:
1. The injured left wrist arm might have result to improper selection of the fuel selector 
valve and led to insufficient fuel to the engine during the take-off power resulted in the 
engine hesitation and quit.
2. The engine recovery and restart attempt were unsuccessful that might be due to the time 
availability and the insufficient aircraft altitude.

(WAJJ) to Wamena Airport, Wamena (WAVV), Papua, Indonesia. On board the aircraft were 
two pilots and one Flight Operation Officer (FOO) as a loadmaster. The flight carried 14,913
kg of cargo. 
The aircraft cruised at altitude 18,000 feet and prior to descend, the pilot observed the weather 
within the criteria of Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC). The pilots able to identify the 
other Trigana flight from Sentani to Wamena in front of them.
The aircraft make orbit in point X which located at 8 Nm from runway 15 to provide 
separation with the aircraft ahead. The aircraft was on sequence number three for landing.
The aircraft ahead safely landed and made the pilot confidence that safe landing would be 
able to be made on the existing weather condition.
About 2,000 feet above airport elevation, the descend approach continued while the weather 
did not meet the visual minima. The pilot reduced the rate of descend twice during the 
descend approach. 
About 1,000 feet above airport elevation, the PM informed to the PF that runway was not in 
sight and advised to go around. About 500 feet above airport elevation, the PF was able to see 
the runway and increased the rate of descend. The pilot noticed that the Enhanced Ground 
Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) aural warning â€œSINK RATEâ€ active. 
The aircraft touched down approximately 125 meters from the beginning runway 15 with 
vertical acceleration of 3.25 g, the aircraft speed 137 knots, pitch 7Â° up and roll to the left 5Â°. 
The calculation of FDR data showed that the rate of descend prior to touch down was 2,300 
feet/minute which was greater than the requirement described on the CASR Part 25.473
Several indications of weather below the visual approach minima, un-stabilized approach, the 
PM suggestion to go around, EGPWS warning, and absence of landing clearance did not 
make the pilot decided to go around. The pilot was sure that he could land the aircraft as the

"On 20 June 2016, a Cessna C172 aircraft registered PK-NIV was being operated by Nusa 
Flying School on a mutual flight training area from Ahmad Yani International Airport 
(WAHS), Semarang to Wedung area, Demak. 
Before commencing the flight, the student pilots conducted preflight check and there was no 
abnormality of the aircraft systems detected. The fuel quantity indicator indicated 120 liters of 
fuel which was sufficient for two-hour flight. No additional fuel tanked at Semarang. 
At 1249 LT (0549 UTC), the aircraft departed from Semarang with two student pilots on 
board which one of the student pilot acted as Pilot Flying (PF), the other acted as Pilot 
Monitoring (PM). The flight from departure until Wedung Area was uneventful. 
After conducted area training exercise for approximately 55 minutes, the pilots were about to 
return to Semarang and was instructed to hold over Wedung Area and maintain 1,000 feet as 
there was an aircraft returning from Jepara Area to Semarang at altitude 2,000 feet.
While holding, the pilot noticed engine problem indicated by decreasing of the propeller 
rotation and aircraft vibration. The pilot performed procedure for identifying the cause and 
checked the ignition position on BOTH, master switch was ON, carburetor heater on position 
STAND BY, mixture on FULL RICH position and the fuel valve selector was slightly on the 
right of ON/BOTH position. 
The pilot was unable to restart the engine by cranking several times and then elected to make 
emergency landing. The PM then informed to the Semarang Approach controller that they 
were making emergency landing. Another training aircraft then relayed to the Semarang 
Approach controller that PK-NIV performed emergency landing on Wedung Area.
At approximately 0636 UTC, the aircraft landed in a fishpond on Wedung Area, at coordinate 
6ï‚°48â€™5.64â€ S 110ï‚°35â€™0.66â€ E, at approximate 16 NM from Semarang on radial 050Â°.
Both student pilots evacuated with minor injury. The aircraft was substantially damaged. The 
fishpond was contaminated with aircraft fuel.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this accident were:
ï‚· The engine failure in flight was caused by improper fuel flow to the engine as the fuel 
selector valve was on intermediate position between BOTH and RIGHT.
ï‚· The deviation of understanding to the fuel system had caused the engine failure inflight 
and did not reselect to the proper position when performing check for cause procedure 
and resulted in the failure to restart the engine.

"On 1 May 2016, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft registered PK-LJR was being operated by PT. 
Lion Mentari Airlines. The aircraft parked at parking stand A33 of Soekarno-Hatta 
International Airport, Jakarta and prepared to continue the flight to Manado as LNI770.
At 1150 UTC (1850 LT), it was dusk light condition, the LNI770 aircraft pushed back from 
parking stand A33 heading to taxiway SC3. The pilot aware that their position was behind an 
Airbus A330 aircraft that was pushing back from parking stand K13 and also heading to 
taxiway SC3. 
The Airbus A330 aircraft registered PK-LEF was being operated by the same company as a 
schedule passenger flight with flight number LNI026 from Jakarta with intended destination 
of Ngurah Rai International Airport, Bali. At 1151 UTC (1851 LT), the LNI026 aircraft
pushed back heading to taxiway SC3 was about to start the engines.
Weather condition at that time was fine and the ground visibility was nine kilometers.
During taxi, the LNI770 pilot deviated to the right from the taxi guideline with intention to 
avoid collision with LNI026. When the LNI770 aircraft position was abeam LNI026 the 
LNI770 pilot felt the aircraft shaking and heard unusual sound.
At that time, the LNI026 pilot just completed engine starting and felt the aircraft shaking. The 
pilots check engine parameters were normal and observed that the LNI770 aircraft was taxiing 
on the right side at position that was very close to the LNI026 aircraft.
The LNI026 pilot by hand signal, requested the ground personnel to reconnect ground 
communication device. After connected, the ground personnel inform that the right wing of 
LNI026 aircraft collided with LNI770. The LNI026 pilot then informed the Soekarno-Hatta 
ground controller that the LNI026 aircraft collided with LNI 770. 
At 1159 UTC, the ground controller advised the LNI770 pilot to stop the taxi. The LNI770 
aircraft position was on taxiway SCX. 
Both aircraft returned to the parking stands and cancelled the flight. No one injured as result 
of this occurrences.
The investigation concerns to several safety issues related to the ground collision between the 
LNI770 and LNI026 aircraft that was on static condition. The aircraft movement analysis was 
based on communication between the air traffic controller, information from interview and the 
damage to the aircraft. The aircraft serviceability was considered not related to the event and 
will not be analyzed.

"On 28 April 2016, a Cessna 172 G aircraft registered PK-TGL was being operated by Global 
Aviation Flying School on a solo flight training with intention to conduct six touch and go 
exercises in Budiarto Airport, Tangerang. On board the aircraft was one student pilot.
The aircraft departed runway 12 and performed three touch and go exercises uneventful.
On fourth touch and go exercise, while turning final at altitude of approximately 550 feet, the 
student pilot noticed that the aircraft speed was 70 knots. 
When the aircraft position was on short final at speed 70 knots with flaps 3, the aircraft 
position was slightly on the right of final approach path and the student pilot attempted to 
align the aircraft with the runway.
While the aircraft at above the runway threshold, the speed was approximately 60 knots, the 
aircraft yawed to the right and the pitch was slightly lower than the normal approach attitude 
thereafter, the student pilot put the throttle smoothly to idle. The aircraft then touched down 
on the right side of runway centerline with nose wheel touched first and the aircraft continued 
moving to the right then stopped outside the runway pavement.
The aircraft stopped out on the right of runway 12 with approximately 305 meters from the 
beginning runway 12 and 23 meters from runway centerline. Investigation found tire marks 
on the runway surface prior to the aircraft final position.
Recognizing the occurrence, the Budiarto Tower Controller activated the crash bell and 
informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) unit. The ARFF personnel 
immediately deployed to the occurrence site. 
Following the occurrence, the student pilot was taken to the nearest medical facility for 
medical examination and there was no injury or medical issue reported. No one injured on this 
occurrence and the aircraft was not damage.
There were no technical and/or aircraft system abnormality reported or recorded prior to the 
occurrence. Therefore, the analysis will not discuss the aircraft serviceability and will discuss 
the issue on landing technique.

"On 4 April 2016, Boeing 737-800 registration PK-LBS was being operated by Batik Air as 
scheduled passenger flight with flight number ID 7703 from Halim Perdanakusuma Airport
with intended destination Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. An ATR 42-
600 aircraft, registration PK-TNJ operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri was being 
repositioned from north to south apron of Halim Perdanakusuma Airport by a ground 
handling agent PT. Jasa Angkasa Semesta (PT. JAS). The aircraft was towed without aircraft 
electrical power fed to the system including the radio communication and aircraft lighting
system. 
At the time of occurrence, the ID 7703 pilot communicated to Halim Tower controller on 
frequency 118.6 MHz while the towing car driver communicated using handheld radio on 
frequency 152.73 KHz and was handled by assistant controller.
At 1948 LT (1248 UTC), ID 7703 pilot received taxi clearance from Halim Tower controller
and after the ID 7703 taxi, the towing car driver received clearance for towing and to report 
when on taxiway C. Afterward the towing car driver was instructed to expedite and to follow 
ID 7703.
While the ID 7703 backtracking runway 24, the towed aircraft entered the runway intended to 
cross and to enter taxiway G. At 1256 UTC, ID 7703 pilot received takeoff clearance and 
initiated the takeoff while the towed aircraft was still on the runway. The towing car driver 
and the pilots took action to avoid the collision. The decision of the pilot and the towing car 
driver to move away from the centerline runway had made the aircraft collision on the 
centerline runway (head to head) avoided, however the wings collision was unavoidable.
At 1257 UTC, the ID 7703 collided with the towed aircraft. The ID 7703 pilot rejected the 
takeoff and stopped approximately 400 meters from the collision point while the towed 
aircraft stopped on the right of the centerline runway 24.
No one injured at this occurrence and both aircraft severely damaged.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to the accident are:
ï‚· Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate 
frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the 
controllers, pilots and towing car driver.
ï‚· The communication misunderstanding of the instruction to follow ID 7703 most likely 
contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway.
ï‚· The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have 
diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that 
was installed with insufficient lightings.
Following this occurrence, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had been 
informed several safety actions taken by related parties. The KNKT acknowledges the safety
actions taken by the operators and aircraft manufacturer, there still remain safety issues that 
need to be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations addressed to PT.

"On 6 November 2015, a Boeing 737-900ER registration PK-LBO was being operated by PT. 
Batik Air Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta International 
Airport, Jakarta (WIII) to Adisutjipto International Airport, Yogyakarta (WAHH) with flight 
number BTK 6380. The flight departed from Jakarta at 0713 UTC with total person on board 
of 168 people and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in 
Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight from departure until commencing 
approach into Yogyakarta was uneventful and there was no report or record of aircraft system 
abnormality during the flight.
After received meteorological information from Aerodrome Terminal Information Services 
(ATIS) the pilot decided to land with configuration flaps 40 and auto-brake 3. While 
approaching Yogyakarta, the pilots noticed cumulonimbus cloud over Yogyakarta then
decided to follow wind shear precaution recommendation to use flaps 30 for landing.
During Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach runway 09, the pilot received information 
that the runway was wet and decided to change the selection of the auto-brake from three to 
maximum.
The FDR data indicated that at altitude 10 feet the speed was 159 knots and floated for 6 
seconds then touched down at 730 meters from beginning runway 09 on speed 154 knots. The 
aircraft stopped at about 84 meters from end of runway 09 and passenger evacuation initiated 
9 minutes after. No one injured in this accident.
Four conditions affecting the landing distance, specifically the aircraft floated for about 6 
seconds and touched down at 427 meter beyond the aim point, after bouncing once; the 
airspeed at touchdown was 13 knots above Vref, and there was average tailwind of 6 knots; 
the thrust reversers were stowed at a higher than recommended speed and there was little 
braking for about 305 meter after the autobrakes were disconnected; and the wet runway 
conditions resulted in less deceleration.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are: 
ï‚· The absence of landing distance calculation following landing reconfiguration and the 
higher speed with no reminder callout might have made the pilots decided to continue 
landing, and
ï‚· The conditions of the aircraft floated and eventually touched down at the end of the 
touchdown zone 13 knots above Vref with average 6 knots tailwind, lower brake pressure 
for 305 meter after the autobrakes were disconnected, and removal of the thrust reverser 
application at a higher than recommended speed along with medium braking action had 
extended the landing distance.
The investigation also considered the external factors such as runway condition might have 
contributed to the reducing of deceleration rate while the brake pressure and thrust reversers 
were close to maximum.
Following this accident PT. Batik Air Indonesia has issued 24 safety actions which considered

"On 19 October 2015, an ATR 72-600 aircraft, registered PK-GAF was being operated by PT. 
Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from El Tari Airport (WATT), Kupang to 
H. Hasan Aroeboesman Airport (WATE), Ende.
At 0445 UTC, the aircraft departed from Kupang and the flight until commenced for approach 
to Ende was uneventful. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as pilot flying (PF) while Second 
in Command (SIC) acted as pilot monitoring (PM). 
At 0537 UTC, the SIC advised to the Ende Aeronautic Communication Officer (ACO) that 
the aircraft was turning on final runway 27. The ACO responded that the wind direction was 
150Â° with velocity of 18 knots and advised that the runway was clear. According to pilot 
observation, the weather was clear without scattered cumulus. On short final, the SIC checked 
the wind shock located on the right side of beginning runway and was coherent to the 
information of the wind condition from the ACO.
The aircraft touched down on the touchdown zone with nose wheel touched the runway first 
and bounced to the left of runway centerline. The aircraft then experienced the second 
touchdown on the left shoulder of the runway. During the second bounce, the master warning 
light illuminated consisted with the â€œPitch Disconnectâ€ warning on the Engine and Warning
Display (EWD). The flight crew applied significant dual and opposite control columns inputs 
(leading to pitch uncoupling mechanism activation) - pitch down by the PIC on left seat and 
pitch up by the SIC on right seat (pitch up authority is higher).
After the second bounce, the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded an increasing value of 
TQs. The pilot performed a go around and turned right to avoid obstacle at the end of the 
runway 27. Both pilots assessed situation and decided to divert to Labuan Bajo. The flight 
continued uneventfully and landed safely at Labuan Bajo.
The investigation determined that the aircraft airworthiness serviceability was not an issue on 
this occurrence. Therefore, the analysis discusses the landing technique and pilot 
coordination. The investigation concluded the contributing factors of the occurrence as 
follows:
ï‚· Continuation of unstabilized approach with too much speed and nose down attitude 
resulted in the nose wheel touched the runway first, and with the roll about 3Â° to the left 
made the aircraft bounce to the left of runway centerline. 
ï‚· The absence of immediate go around initiation after the first bounce resulted in the aircraft 
made second touched down on the left shoulder of the runway.

"On 29 May 2015, a liberty XL2 aircraft registered PK-LLA was being operated by 
Lombok Institute of Flight Technology (LIFT) on solo touch-and-go circuit
exercises1 at Selaparang Airport, Lombok2
(WADA) and the student pilot was the 
only person on board the aircraft.
Prior the flight, the student pilot was briefed by another student pilot who used the 
PK-LLA aircraft. The other student pilot advised experiencing hard landing however, 
the aircraft condition appeared remain normal. The other student pilot did not 
consider that the hard landing was occurrence that need to be reported. The student 
pilot then conducted preflight check of the aircraft condition and considered that the 
aircraft condition was normal included the nose landing gear.
About 1500 LT (0700 UTC3
), the aircraft departed runway 27 of Lombok with the 
fuel onboard sufficient for three hours flight time, the departure process until the 
third touch and go exercise was uneventful. During landing approach of the fourth 
touch and go, the student pilot used flaps 20Â° with speed about 75 knots. The aircraft 
touched down and continued rolling with the flaps still on 20Â°. When the speed was
about 40 knots, the student pilot felt the nose wheel impacted a patched-runway and 
bounced. The aircraft then touched down harder than usual, to recover the bounce, 
the student pilot increased the engine power and continued to go around. 
At 0740 UTC, the air traffic controller (controller) received information from 
aviation security officer that there was a detached nose wheel on the runway. After 
knowing that the detached nose wheel was from PK-LLA aircraft, the controller
informed the situation to the student pilot and instructed to make holding on left 
downwind runway 27. The controller also coordinated with other related units 
including Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) and LIFT representative.

communicated with the student pilot to calm down the student pilot. The flight 
instructor instructed to perform a slow flight with flap 30Â° to minimized the aircraft 
speed and to perform low pass over runway 27 for landing gear observation. The 
student pilot performed low pass flying four times over runway 27.
Since the wind direction was from 090Â° until 120Â° with velocity of 8 to 10 knots, the 
flight instructor advised the controller to change the runway in use to runway 09 and 
was approved. The flight instructor then instructed the student pilot to exercise a low 
pass on runway 09. The student pilot performed low pass three times over runway 
09. The flight instructor briefed the student pilot of how to make landing approach in

PT. Total E & P Indonesia. The flight was planned from Sepinggan Airport, Balikpapan to 
Handil helipad than continued flying over Central Processing Unit (CPU) to conduct pipe line 
inspection and return to Sepinggan.
At 0118 UTC, the helicopter departed Sepinggan with destination Handil helipad. On board in 
this flight were eight occupants consisted of two pilots, one engineer, one flight operation 
officer (FOO) and four passengers. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) 
and Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 0136 UTC, the helicopter 
landed at Handil helipad and refueled up to approximately 1,600 lbs for the preparation to the 
pipe line inspection flight that was estimated would take 2 hours. The passenger doors on both 
sides of the cabin were removed to ease the inspection. 
At 0205 UTC, the helicopter departed from Handil helipad to CPU. On board this flight were 
seven occupants from Sepinggan consist of two pilots, one flight operation officer (FOO) and 
four passengers, while the engineer stayed at Handil.
After reached the cruising altitude of 1,000 feet the PIC handed over the control to the SIC. 
The SIC engaged the autopilot and flew maintain cruise altitude and speed of 95 knot. The 
weather was clear, wind condition was westerly at speed of 5 knots and visibility 
approximately 8 km. At position approximately 8 Nm from CPU the PIC asked the SIC to 
descend to 600 feet with the rate of 200 feet/minute. While passing 800 feet the helicopter 
attitude became un-commanded. The helicopter rolled to the left and pitch up then rolled to 
the right and pitch down. The SIC lowered the collective and reduced the helicopter speed 
with intention to recover the helicopter attitude with no success. The PIC took over the 
control to recover the helicopter until impacted the tree and crash into swamp. All the 
occupants were survived.
KNKT conducted several tests and research and concluded that the separation of rod end 
bearing from the push rod resulted to the helicopter enters un-commanded attitude.
The investigation determined the contributing factor was the helicopter un-commanded 
attitude caused by loosening of the jam nut on the forward rod end bearing which 
subsequently separated from the push rod, resulted in the un-commanded servo movement.
As result of these accidents FAA issued the Airworthiness Directive related to inspection of

"On 9 September 2014 an aircraft Cessna C208B, registration PK-RSC was being operated by 
PT Enggang Air Service for an unscheduled flight route from Sentani Airport to Mulia 
Airport, which conducted under Visual Flight Rule (VFR) and the Pilot in Command (PIC). 
The aircraft was airworthy and flown within the weight and balance envelope, and there was 
no abnormality on the systems and or others until the time of the occurrence. 
Before the aircraft join the initial approach pattern to Mulia the pilot was able to contact with 
Mulia AFIS and received information include that on the final and gap area which was about 
2 nm of runway 08 were clear and the wind was westerly 8 knots. 
The Mulia Airport was located at approximately 5,500 feet of elevation and 10% up slope 
runway which normally covered by clouds during the afternoon hours. 
According to the pilot interview, the approach crew briefing and the approach check list was 
performed prior to land on runway 08, no traffic on the ground and the runway was clear. The 
landing procedures were completed at about 6000 feet (approximate 500 feet Above Ground 
Level), and the aircraft aligned with the runway. 
The aircraft touched down within the touchdown point of runway 08, then bounced and 
floated. After second touchdown the aircraft started to veer to the left, the pilot recovered by 
the applying reverse thrust and brake, however the aircraft continued veered to the left. 
The aircraft stopped on the left side of the runway with left main and nose landing gear 
damaged and sunken into soft soil. 
The engine shutdown and the passengers disembark the aircraft normally. No persons injured 
in this occurrence. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident were; 
â€¢ The illusion of the runway condition resulted to the pilot misinterpret the situation and 
late to flare on touchdown and bounced. 
â€¢ The recovery action performed by the pilot resulted to the force that moved the aircraft 
further to the left and difficult to recover back to the runway centerline.

"The Angkasa Pura I Brach Office Surabaya as the airport operator of Juanda International 
Airport Surabaya (WARR) planned to perform runway maintenance that would be conducted at 
night after the runway operation. 
On 11 June 2014, between 0100 to 0500 LT, The Angkasa Pura I Brach Office Surabaya started
the runway maintenance that was performed by another company and consisted of 10 personnel
and used tools including pneumatic compressor, jack hammer, chisel, high air pressure hose, 
asphalt mixer, small container for asphalt mixture, debris sweeper and other supporting 
equipment. 
At 0405 LT, the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighter (ARFF) personnel performed the ARFF and
the Airport Facility Readiness personnel conducted runway readiness check in conjunction with 
patrolling the airside used patrol car. At 0430 LT, they reported to Juanda Tower controller that 
the runway was clear from any hazard except the area near intersection N3 where the runway 
repair was still in progress. At 0450 LT, the airport maintenance team reported to Juanda Tower 
controller that the runway repair had finished and the runway maintenance team had left the 
runway. No runway inspection was performed after the runway repair finished.
At 0500 LT, the airport operation initiated. Between 0500 LT and 0606 LT, 11 aircraft departure 
and one arrival, no pilot reported the foreign object on the runway. The first pilot report of 
objects was near the intersection taxiway N5 and was made at 0609 LT which was after sunrise 
at 0559 LT. This indicated that the objects were not clearly visible during dark time.
At 0615 LT, the controller contacted the Airport Facility Readiness personnel but no reply,
thereafter the controller contacted the ARFF personnel informed the pilot report of object on the 
runway and requested to check the existence of the reported object. When the ARFF vehicle 
arrived near the runway the controller instructed to wait for three aircraft that were about to 
land.
At 0620 LT, an ATR 72-212A (600 version) registered PK-WGK with flight number IW1861 
landed and impacted chisel, resulted in eight holes on the aircraft lower fuselage.

"A Kodiak-100 aircraft, registered PK-SDF, on 9 April 2014 was being operated by PT. 
Adventist Aviation Indonesia as non-schedule flight from Doyo Baru Airstrip with 
intended destination of Ninia Airstrip, Papua. On board in this flight were 7 persons consist 
of one pilot and six passengers. 
This flight was the fourth flights for the pilot. The flight time to Ninia was estimated of 1 
hour and was planned at cruising altitude of 10,000 feet and the fuel on board were 
sufficient for 4 hours flight time. 
At 0024 UTC, the pilot received clearance for takeoff. 
At 0027 UTC, Sentani Tower controller has not received reports from the PK-SDF pilot 
and tried to call but was not responded. 
At 0030 UTC, The Chief Section of Sentani Tower Air Navigation obtained information 
that the aircraft had experienced an accident during takeoff at Doyo Baru. 
The aircraft failed to lift off and impacted to several objects prior to stop at 30 meters from 
the end of the runway. The nose section damage after consumed by post impact fire. 
Two occupants including the pilot were fatally injured and five other occupants seriously 
injured. All occupants were taken to Yowari Hospital (Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah â€“ 
RSUD Yowari). 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this occurrence was due to the 
aircraft was not in the correct takeoff configuration which required wing flap 20Â° while the 
flap was found on position of 6Â° during impact. The investigation concluded that the flap 
was selected during the takeoff roll when the pilot realized that the aircraft did not airborn 
on the position where normally became airborne. The pilot also operated the Emergency 
Power Lever intended to add more engine power. The corrective actions to recover the 
situation by selection of emergency power lever and flap were not proper for particular 
condition.

Abadi Air, as scheduled passenger flight. The aircraft departed Pomala Airport, Sulawesi 
Tenggara at 0710 UTC (1510 LT) to Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar, Sulawesi Selatan. 
On board in this flight were two pilots, two flight attendants and 73 passengers. The Second 
in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot 
Non Flying (PNF). 
The pilot elected to fly via MKS VOR to avoid cumulonimbus cloud on the south east area 
from Makassar. The flight then vectored for Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach 
runway 03. 
At 1500 feet, the Hasanuddin Tower controller and was provided the landing clearance with 
additional information of wind which was from 120Â° up to 23 knots. Refer to the information 
from the controller and considered the experience of the SIC, the PIC took over the control of 
the aircraft and the SIC performed the duty as PNF.
The PIC noticed that on the right side of the final course was dark and thick cloud, while on 
the left was clear. 
At 08.00 UTC, the aircraft touched down normal on the touchdown zone. The pilot started to 
applied the brake and reverse the propeller. The FDR recorded that after touchdown, left 
rudder was applied gradually from 3Â° up to 27Â° and the aircraft heading was varied between

serious incident is using short report format. 
On 28 January 2014 a Cessna 172S registration PK-BOB operated by LOKA Pendidikan dan 
Pelatihan Penerbang was conducting solo area flight training. Prior to the occurrence the 
aircraft was airworthy and there was no abnormality reported and the weather reported met 
the criteria for visual flight.
After returning from the area, and during approach on short final runway 08 at approximately 
200 feet, the student pilot observed another aircraft on runway and decided to go rround, at 
the same time the Blimbingsari Tower controller issued landing clearance and the student 
pilot cancelled the decision to go around and elected to continue landing. 
During landing the aircraft bounced two times then student pilot performed go around and 
during climbing the student pilot heard unusual sound from the engine. On downwind, the 
student pilot felt difficulty in controlling the aircraft. The aircraft landed safely.
Observations on the runway found that there were two scratch marks at approximate 200 feet 
from the beginning runway 08. The aircraft examination found the nose wheel tire come out 
from the hub and both propeller blades tip bent.
The student pilot had total flying hours of 20 hours 32 minutes including 06 hours and 5 
minutes on type, the student pilot has been scheduled for 40 minutes flying in the 90 days
excluding the serious incident flight.

Sriwijaya Air on schedule passenger flight from Sepinggan Airport, Balikpapan (BPN / 
WALL) to Juanda International Airport, Surabaya (SUB / WARR). The aircraft departed from 
Balikpapan at 0109 UTC. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) and 
the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF). 
Prior to the flight both pilots did not receive information of the current NOTAM (Notice to 
Airmen) for Juanda International Airport either from Balikpapan or Jakarta flight operation 
office. On the day of this serious incident, there was a NOTAM regarding to the status of 
taxiway SP2 that was closed due to work in progress of scrubbing, overlay and paving 
shoulder and was valid from 1 to 30 January 2014. 
The pilot conducted the VOR/DME approach for runway 28. During the interview the PM 
stated that the weather was hazy and at 600 feet, both pilots saw the darker and shinier object 
on the surrounding area which they assumed as the runway. The pilots flew toward the object 
and raised some question to the controller regarding to the several objects on the runway. 
The aircraft flew at low altitude below 50 feet over the taxiway SP2 up to touch down for 
approximately 29 seconds. 
There was hazard report from a pilot reported the possibility of mistaking taxiway for runway 
during conducting a VOR/DME approach runway 28, which was received 30 days before this 
occurrence. 
No one injured and no damage to the aircraft in this serious incident. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident were as 
follow; 
â€¢ The environment of the airport and the condition of the taxiway approach created an 
illusion that the SP2 taxiway appeared brighter than the active runway for pilot on the 
final approach. 
â€¢ The absence of the operator SOP related to the requirement for go around on uncertain 
condition and the NOTAM information which might became the short term memory

The investigation found that the airport environment and taxiway approach created an illusion that the SP2 taxiway appeared brighter than the active runway. The absence of operator SOP and NOTAM information made the pilot continue landing under uncertain conditions. The KNKT issued safety recommendations to PT. Sriwijaya Air, PT. Angkasa Pura I, Airnav Indonesia of Surabaya, and Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address the safety issues identified in the final report."
"On 19 January 2014, a PA-31-350 Piper Chieftain, registered PK-IWT, was being operated by 
PT. Intan Angkasa Air Service, on positioning flight from Sentani Airport, Jayapura with 
intended destination of Juanda Airport, Surabaya for aircraft maintenance. The positioning 
flight was planned to transit at Dumatubun Airport Langgur of Tual, Maluku and Haluoleo 
Airport, Kendari at South East Sulawesi for refuelling.
On the first sector, the aircraft departed Sentani Airport at 2351 UTC (0851 WIT) and 
estimated arrival at Langgur was 0320 UTC. On board on this flight was one pilot, two 
company engineers and one ground staff.
At 0240 UTC the pilot contacted to the Langgur FISO, reported that the aircraft position was 
85 Nm to Langgur Airport at altitude 10,000 feet and requested weather information. Langgur
FISO acknowledged and informed that the weather was rain and thunderstorm and the runway 
in used was 09.
When the aircraft passing 5,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Langgur FISO and reported that 
the aircraft position was 50 Nm from langgur and informed the estimated time of arrival was 
0320 UTC. The Langgur FISO acknowledged and advised the pilot to contact when the 
aircraft was at long final runway 09.
At 0318 UTC, the pilot contacted Langgur FISO, reported the position was 25 Nm to Langgur
at altitude of 2,500 feet and requested to use runway 27. The Langgur FISO advised the pilot 
to contact on final runway 27.
At 0325 UTC, Langgur FISO contacted the pilot with no reply.
At 0340 UTC, Langgur FISO received information from local people that the aircraft had 
crashed.
The aircraft was found at approximately 1.6 Nm north east of Langgur Airport at coordinate 
5Â° 38â€™ 30.40â€ S; 132Â° 45â€™ 21.57â€ E. All occupants fatally injured and the aircraft destroyed by 
impact force and post impact fire.
The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post impact fire, several parts of the 
remaining wreckage such as cockpit could not be examined due to the level of damage. The 
aircraft was not equipped with flight recorders and the communication between ATC and the 
pilot was not recorded. No eye witness saw the aircraft prior to impact. Information available 
for the investigation was limited. The analysis utilizes available information mainly on the 
wreckage information including the information of the wings, engines and propellers.
Based on the available evidences, the investigation concluded that the left engine failed 
during approach. The propeller did not set to feather resulted in significant asymmetric forces 
on the left and right side of the aircraft. The asymmetric forces created yaw and roll tendency 
and the aircraft became uncontrolled, subsequently led the aircraft to impact to the terrain.
Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had not been informed any safety action 
taken by related parties. KNKT issue safety recommendations to address safety issues 
identified on this investigation to aircraft operator and Directorate General of Civil Aviation 
(DGCA).

"On 13 December 2013 an Airbus A330, registration PK-GPN operated by PT. Garuda 
Indonesia was on scheduled passenger flight from Ngurah Rai International Airport (WADD), 
Bali, to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (WIII), Tangerang, Indonesia. On board in this 
flight were two pilots, 11 flight attendants, 185 passengers. 
There was no reported or recorded that the aircraft had system abnormality during the flight 
from take-off until the time of the occurrence. 
The weather report for Soekarno-Hatta International Airport was broadcasted at 08.00 UTC 
and 08.45 UTC was moderate rain, thunder storm, wind direction was north-westerly and no 
significant weather were reported. 
At 124 ft, the autopilot was disengaged and the pilot resumed hand flying. Prior to touchdown 
after Flight Warning Computer (FWC) callout â€œTWENTYâ€, the SIC called â€œfly leftâ€ for two 
times, and followed by the FWC callout â€œRETARDâ€ for tree times within three seconds. 
During the interview, the pilots explained that at about flare out altitude the aircraft entered a 
heavy rain impacted the left windshield and the PF loss of visual reference. The PF also felt 
that the aircraft floating. The PNF explained that he was able to see the runway all the time 
and observed that the aircraft was slightly on the right of the runway and advised the PF to fly 
left two times. 
At 08.00 UTC the aircraft touched down with the right main landing gear were on the right 
shoulder and travelled for 500 meters and returned to the runway then proceeded to taxiway 
S5. 
The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft system, therefore the 
analysis part of this final report focused on four safety issues, such as: course deviation prior 
to touchdown, approach and landing techniques, decision to land and meteorological 
concerning to the observing and reporting of visibility. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this serious incident were as the 
following factors: 
During the hand flying at approximately 90 feet AGL the aircraft started rolled in average 
of 2Â° to the right for approximately 12 seconds resulted to aircraft deviation to the right, 
whilst the PF loss the visual reference and prolong flare prior to touch down. 
â€¢ The above condition was an indication for go around which was not executed, this 
might cause by insufficient pilot intuitive decision to cope such condition. 
â€¢ The absence of no significant weather report might influence the pilot judgment and 
expectation of any weather change which may requires pilot decisions especially 
when occurs at low altitude. 
Following this serious incident, the VP Flight Operation of PT. Garuda Indonesia issued 
safety actions as shown in the appendix 6 of this final report. 
As result from the investigation Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi issued several

"On 20 November 2013, an Air Bus A320 operated by Indonesia Air Asia (IAA) was on 
schedule passenger flight from Adisutjipto Airport, Yogyakarta to Ngurah Rai Airport, 
Bali, with flight number AWQ 8411. 
At 00:36 the AWQ pilot requested taxi clearance and was cleared to taxi to holding point 
runway 27 via November Two (N2) by Adi Tower controller. The pilot reconfirm that the 
taxi way was N2 and requested to taxi via November Three (N3) taxiway. The Adi Tower 
controller reconfirm that the taxi way was N2 and continued by providing ATC clearance. 
The pilot tought that they were cleared to taxi to holding point runway 27 which was 
located on the taxiway N3, close to the runway 27 threshold. There was no other traffic 
communicated with Adi Tower controller. 
Prior the aircraft entered the runway the PIC shouted that there was an aircraft on final. 
Almost at the same time Adi Tower controller instructed to AWQ 8441 pilot to hold at 
present position. The PIC instinctively selected the throttles to reverse and applied brake to 
stop the aircraft and if possible moved backward. The aircraft stopped with the nose 
section 16 meters passed the yellow marking line of N2 taxiway on approximate heading 
170. 
A Boeing B737-900 operated by PT Batik Air on flight number ID 6360 was on regular 
passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta, Airport Jakarta to Adisutjipto Airport Yogyakarta 
and was under control Yogya Approach controller. 
The Yogya Approach controller advised to the pilot that runway was clear and gave 
clearance to land if the runway insight. 
The BTK pilot reported that the runway insight when the aircraft was on 3.5 miles to touch 
down. The Yogya Approach controller advised the pilot to contact Adi Tower controller 
after landing. 
After saw that the AWQ aircraft has entered the runway, while the BTK aircraft was 
approximately at 600 feet, the Adi Tower controller advised to the Yogya Approach 
controller to instruct BTK pilot to go around. The instruction was not passed to BTK pilot 
with consideration that the BTK aircraft was on short final and a go around might 
jeopardized the safety of the flight. 
The Adi Tower controller instructed BTK pilot to go around, however this instruction was 
not acknowledge by BTK pilots. 
Just after touched down, the BTK pilot saw that of the AWQ aircraft was on taxiway N2 
and the nose section had entered the runway. The BTK pilot then applied the maximum 
manual braking and full thrust reverse and the aircraft stopped at approximately 100 meters 
to the AWQ aircraft position. 
Refer to the calculation the required landing distance for medium braking action was 6,614 
feet or 2,016 meters and for good braking action was 4,813 feet or 1,467 meters. The 
vi 
landing distance of the BTK aircraft was approximately 1650 meters. The pilot action had 
avoided a collision between aircrafts. 
The investigation determined contributing factors involve in this occurrence were: 
â€¢ Misinterpretation between pilots and controller related to the position of holding point 
runway 27 and the taxi clearance had never been clearly clarified. 
â€¢ There was no transfer of control from Yogya Approach controller to Adi Tower 
controller and the landing clearance for the BTK flight was issued by Yogya Approach 
controller resulting to the initiative instruction from Adi Tower controller to BTK pilot 
to go around was not acknowledged by BTK pilots.

"On 12 September 2013 a Cessna 152 aircraft registered PK-KFC operated by PT Aviasi 
Solusi Prima (FlyBest Flight Academy) conducted a local flight training from Hang Nadim 
Airport, Batam. On board the aircraft were a student pilot who acted as Pilot Flying and a 
flight instructor who acted as Pilot Non Flying. 
There was no abnormality in the aircraft system since the taxied out and took off at 23:50 
UTC. During climbed to 1500 feet the student pilot increased the power and noted that the 
engine RPM was only 2,200 RPM, instead of 2500 RPM. Few moments later, while the 
aircraft altitude at 1,500 feet the engine power started to decrease to 2,000 RPM. The pilot 
requested to return to Hang Nadim Airport. Finally the oil pressure dropped to zero, and the 
engine was still running for about 15 second before stopped. The pilot performed emergency 
procedure and tried to restart the engine but unsuccessful then decided to make an emergency 
landing over the sea. The aircraft ditched on radial 158Â° and 8 Nm from BTM VOR. 
The instructor and the student pilot on board were minor injured and the aircraft up-side 
down and floated on the sea. 
The flying school was initiated on January 2013 and lean air mixture procedure was 
introduced. Since June 2013, the flying school changed the fuel type from AVGAS to 
MOGAS and the lean takeoff procedure was still applied. 
The maintenance record showed that the aircraft was grounded on 7 and 11 Sepâ€™13 due to 
loss of power during the engine power check. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of the accident were as follow: 
1. The engine were overheating for some period of time (few days) as result of the 
combination of lean mixture in high engine power and the use of lower octane fuel 
which in the area of heavy detonation zone. 
2. The process of the change of AVGAS to MOGAS which was classified as alteration 
was not accordance with the CASR sub part 43.13.

aircraft operation was as a non-schedule cargo flight.
The aircraft departed from Sentani Airport, Jayapura, Papua to Wamena Airport, Wamena,
Papua at 06:54 LT (21:54 UTC on 16 January 2013).
The person onboard were two pilots; on the left side pilot under training as a pilot flying act
as second in command (SIC) and on the right side as an instructor and pilot monitoring act as
Pilot in Command (PIC).
During flight from Sentani to Wamena, the aircraft was normal, no indication of any
malfunction.
The Wamena weather on was VMC, wind calm, runway slippery due to water and rubber
deposit contaminated; the raining was stopped 20 minutes before the occurrence.
The aircraft was touchdown on runway 15 at 0801 LT (23:01 on the canter line, and then the
pilot flying applied reverse. During reverse, the aircraft veer off to the right and the pilot
flying tried to recover by pushing left rudder followed by the application left brake, but no
response and the aircraft continues veer to the right.
Just before out of the runway the SIC apply full reverse, the PIC instructed to add the power
aimed to make the rudder effectiveness and then took over the controls. The PIC adds the
power control lever forward try to straight the aircraft.
At approximately 157 meters from first touchdown the aircraft was out of right runway and
continue rolling over the runway shoulder, approximate 15 meters parallel to the runway.
The aircraft hit taxiway marking Alpha, caused the horizontal stabilizer, left wing tip and left
aileron detached from the wing. The aircraft become airborne again at a distance if 315 meters
from touchdown and continues rolling until approximately 408 meters from the first
touchdown the aircraft entered the runway again, and then the aircraft taxied to the Yajasi
apron and parked.
No person on board injured and the aircraft had major damaged.
The analysis part of this report discussed all the relevant issues related to aircraft veer off to
the right of runway. Because of the aircraft was not equipped with a Flight Data Recorder or

"On 19 October 2012 a Boeing 737-400 aircraft registered PK-CKN on flight number SJ182, 
was being operated by PT. Sriwijaya Air, as a schedule passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta 
International Airport (WIII), Jakarta to Supadio International Airport (WIOO), Pontianak. 
At 0735 UTC, the aircraft was pushed back at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, on board 
the flight was 166 persons consisted of two pilots, four flight attendants, 160 passengers. 
Based on interview, the pilots stated that while en-route they received the weather information 
from Air Traffic Controller which informing that current weather at Supadio Airport was 
raining and thunderstorm with the horizontal visibility 6 km. 
The flight was vectored by Pontianak Approach to join the ILS runway 15 than contact to 
Supadio Tower when established localizer. 
At 800 ft the pilot called Supadio Tower, that they could see the runway and then Supadio 
Tower replied by giving a landing clearance. 
At 50 ft, the FDR recorded that the tail wind component was 10 knot and the aircraft speed 13 
kts higher than the Target Vref. The aircraft stopped with the main wheels at about 2 meters 
from the end of stop-way runway 15 and the nose wheels sunk into the soft surface. 
The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft and all systems related 
to this occurrence. Therefore the discussion focused on the issues of: landing distance 
calculation, approach preparation and hydroplaning. 
The investigation concluded that contributing factors was the absence of approach briefing 
particularly on reviewing of landing distance might have decreased the pilotâ€™s awareness 
toward better flight justification. This condition affected to the pilot justification which 
resulting the approach speed was 13 kts above Vref when the aircraft at 50 ft. And this 
particular condition was classified as un-stabilized approach and requires the pilot to go 
around. 
Prior to issue this final investigation report, the KNKT had been informed of safety actions 
resulting of the internal investigation by the operators concerning to the operational safety 
related to this occurrence.

"On 13 October 2012, a Boeing 737-300 aircraft was being operated by Sriwijaya Air 
conducted a scheduled passenger flight from Polonia International Airport, Medan (WIMM) 
to Minangkabau International Airport (WIPT), Padang. 
The aircraft departed Polonia International Airport with flight number SJY 021, on board the 
aircraft were 102 persons consisted of two pilots, four flight attendants and 96 passengers. 
The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) 
acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight was the first flight on that day.
The flight from departure until commencing for approach was un-eventful and mostly was on 
Instrument Meteorological Condition (IMC). 
Considering to the cloud condition, the pilot requested runway 33 for the Instrument Landing 
System (ILS) approach and it was approved by the Minang Approach. On descend the pilots 
conducted approach briefing for ILS approach runway 33 according to the Instrument 
Approach Procedure (IAP) chart. The pilots stated that the information contained in the 
approach chart of â€œTabbing (can be mistaken for Minangkabau Intl)â€ was absent during the 
briefing.
When the flight had established to the localizer, the PIC saw a runway at approximately 10Â° 
on the right, the pilot then reported to Minang Approach that the runway was in sight and was 
instructed to contact Minangkabau Tower controller. The pilot intended to make a visual 
approach and disconnected the autopilot then flew manually toward that runway. When 
conducting the visual approach, the pilot assumed that the localizer was incorrect as the 
runway was on the right side. The pilot continued the approach with landing gear down and 
flap 40. The PIC also realized that the rate of descent was about 1,700 feet per minute.
After landing, the pilot reported to Minang tower that they had landed at Tabing Airfield. The 
passengers were completely disembarked safely.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are the unclear 
significant information in the photocopy of the ILS approach chart might have missed by the 
pilot and might reduce the pilot awareness to the adjacent airport with similar runway 
direction and dimension; the previous experience of false VOR might have made the approach 
was continued in an un-stabilized approach condition, and the information of incorrect 
runway was not provided during the abnormal approach as it was not observed.
Following this accident the aircraft operator has issued six safety actions and the airport 
operator has issued two safety actions which considered relevant to improve safety. In 
addition, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to aircraft operator, air navigation

PK-ODA departed from Timika Airport 2 Papua. The helicopter operated by PT. Airfast 
Indonesia was on an unscheduled charter flight by Freeport Indonesia Company. The flight 
was planned from Timika to Utikinagon (helipad) â€“ Mile post (MP) 66 (helipad) â€“ Wanagon 
(helipad) â€“ MP 66 â€“ Timika. 
The helicopter carried four passengers and food supplies to Utikinagon. At Utikinagon the 
helicopter dropped three passengers and food supplies then picked up another three 
passengers. The helicopter flew to MP 66 with four passengers on board. At MP 66 the 
helicopter disembarked three passengers and picked up the food supplies, to be delivered to 
Wanagon. 
At Wanagon the helicopter dropped one passenger and the food supplies and picked up two 
passengers and returned to MP 66. During the flight to MP 66, the pilot received a radio call 
to pick up one passenger from West Gully. West Gully is located approximately on radial 100 
from Wanagon and on the left side of the track to MP 66 which was approximately 180Â°. The 
pilot flew to West Gully and attempted to land twice but unsuccessful due to poor visibility. 
The pilot then decided to continue to MP 66. 
While approaching MP 66 the pilot could not land due to weather and decided to divert to 
Landville (MP 73). At 23.10 the pilot made radio call to company radio frequency and 
informed his intention to divert to MP 73. This was the last communication with the pilot. 
MP 73 located north east of MP 66 at lower elevation. Normally the ground visibility better 
than MP 66 and at several times diversion flights successfully land at MP 73. There was no 
radio room at MP 73 for the crew to make radio communication other than aircraft radio.

"On 19 December 2011, a Cessna 172P aircraft registered as PK-WTF was being operated by 
Wings Flying School on a flight training from Cakrabhuwana Airport (WICD), Cirebon to 
Karang Ampel training area with Visual Flight Rules. On board the aircraft consisted of one 
flight instructor and one student. 
At 1233 LT (0533 UTC), the aircraft departed from Cirebon then flew via Suranengala to 
Karang Ampel area.
At 0545 UTC, the aircraft reached Karang Ampel area and conducted training exercises of 
climbing turn, steep turn, stall recovery, slow flight descend and engine failure exercise. 
During the engine failure exercise, the student pilot performed clearing engine procedure 
several times. At altitude 700 feet, the student pilot made a go around and climbed to intended 
altitude of 1,500 feet for returning to Cirebon. During climbing, the pilots saw that the engine 
power indicated 1,800 rpm, and the pilot felt that the engine was hesitating. The flight 
instructor then took over the aircraft control performed forced landing to coastline area at 
approximately 3 Nm north of checkpoint Suranenggala. 
The aircraft touched down on the muddy surface and flipped. The flight instructor and the 
student evacuated the aircraft and no one injured in this occurrence.
Investigation conducted examination to the engine to determine the cause of the engine 
failure. The engine examination did not find any abnormality. The examination of induction 
system found a piece of rubber at the inside of the throttle chamber of the carburetor with
dimension of 12 cm length and 0.8 cm width that believed originated from the flapper valve 
of the induction box. 
The detachment of the rubber presumably due to repeated bending action against the box wall 
at â€œCLOSEâ€ position caused fatigue to the rubber.
The presence of the rubber in the throttle chamber interrupted the supply of fuel air mixture to 
the piston chamber and resulted in the improper combustion. The improper combustion was 
identified by the pilot as the engine hesitation.
Prior to this publishing of this report, the operator has stopped the training operation.
Following this accident, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had been 
informed safety actions taken by the Wings Flying School and the KNKT acknowledges the 
safety actions. However, there still remain safety issues that need to be considered and

and recovered amidst vegetation at a rain forest several weeks after the accident about 300 
meters from the accident site approximately on the flight path. 
The examination of the cable (long-line) and the tail rotor blade provided evidence consistent 
with the tail rotor blade striking the cable. The cable strike, in turn, resulted in the tail rotor 
system entering an extreme out-of-balance condition, manifesting into loads that fractured 
the mounting bulkhead of the 90Â° gearbox and resulted an uncontrollable flight due to the 
significant shift to centre of gravity (CG). 
Following this investigation the NTSC issued several safety recommendations to the 
Indonesia Directorate General of Civil Aviation, and PT. Airfast Indonesia.

During the flight there were no abnormal condition related to aircraft system or other 
significant information was reported. 
The ATC instructed the pilot to commence the VOR approach Runway 35 and circling 
Runway 17. The pilots were able to see the runway at approximate 4 DME and continued 
the circling procedure by joined circuit pattern of runway 17. When turned on the base leg 
runway 17, the PM saw and assessed that the aircraft was above the normal glide path, 
turned too early and the aircraft was on the right of the centerline. Realizing to the 
conditions, the PM decided to take over the control and continued the approach to land. The 
PIC tried to correct the glide path by increasing the rate of descend (ROD), reducing the 
power and rolled to bring the aircraft aligned with the runway centerline. 
At 0709 UTC, the aircraft touched down on runway 17 and was slightly deviated to the 
right of the runway centerline and stopped on the runway. The ATC instructed the pilot to 
stop the aircraft and verified of a probability of a hard landing which was confirmed by the 
pilot. The FDR recorded vertical acceleration of 3.473 G. 
There were no one injured in this occurrence. 
The investigation had determined that there were no issues with the aircraft and all systems 
were operating normally. The analysis was focus on these following 3 safety issues: 
â€¢ Un-stabilized approach below 500ft.

including four children and four infants, two pilot and four flight attendant. A 
maintenance engineer was on-board in this flight. Acting as pilot flying was the Second 
in Command (SIC) while the Pilot in Command acted as Pilot Monitoring. 
On approach, the pilot selected landing gear to down position. The left main landing gear 
indicator light was showed red, its means that the left main landing gear was not in down 
position and unsafe for landing. 
The pilot reported to the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) for a go-around and requested an 
area for holding to solve the problem. The ATC gave a clearance to hold over Kupang 
bay. 
The pilot tried to solve the problem by conducting the procedure according to the 
emergency checklist, including selected the landing gear by alternate selector. 
The pilot then requested to the ATC to fly at low altitude over the airport and asked to 
the ATC to observe the landing gear condition. The pilot also asked through the company 
radio for an engineer on-ground to observe visually the landing gear condition. 
The pilot then returned to the holding area, repeated the procedure but unsuccessful. 
Both pilots and engineer had a discussion and decided to attempt un-procedural method 
to make the landing gear down. Prior making these efforts the pilot announced to the 
passengers about the problem and their attempts that might be unpleasant to the 
passengers. 
After all attempts to lower the landing gear had failed, the pilot decided to land with the

"On 30 October 2009, a Boeing Company 737-300 aircraft, operated by Garuda 
Indonesia as flight GA142, registered PK-GGQ, was being flown on a scheduled 
passenger service from Soekarnoâ€“Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Sultan Iskandar Muda 
Airport, Banda Aceh, via Polonia Airport, Medan. There were 55 persons on board; 
two pilots, four flight attendants, and 49 passengers. 
The aircraft took off from Jakarta runway 07L at 0129 UTC. During the takeoff the 
number-two wheel separated from its axle and fell from the aircraft onto the runway. 
The air traffic controller subsequently informed the crew that one of the aircraftâ€™s 
main wheels had fallen from the aircraft onto the runway during the takeoff. The pilot 
in command (PIC) decided to return to Jakarta. The controller informed the airport 
rescue and fire fighting service (RFFS), and RFFS personnel and vehicles stood by 
during the landing. 
The PIC taxied the aircraft off the runway and stopped it on taxiway NP1. The 
passengers disembarked normally via airstairs about 15 minutes after the landing. The 
RFFS crews were standing by the aircraft in case of a fire. None of the aircraftâ€™s 
occupants were injured. 
The investigation determined that it was likely that the detachment of the number-two 
main wheel from its axle was due to the catastrophic failure of the wheel bearings. 
The bearing failures would then have resulted from an under-torque condition during 
the re-installation of the number-two main wheel, following the replacement of the 
brake unit. 
The recent main wheel installation was conducted on the airport apron during the 
hours of darkness, and flash lights were used to illuminate the work. The work 
environment was not conducive to ensuring that the work could be performed safely

aircraft, registered PK-NVC, operated by PT. Merpati Nusantara Airlines as flight 
number MZ-7960D, departed from Sentani Airport, Jayapura for Oksibil Airport. 
The flight was planned in accordance with the visual flight rules (VFR). There 
were 15 persons on board; two pilots, one engineer, 10 adult passengers and two 
infants. 
The estimated flight time was 50 minutes. The fuel on board was sufficient for 2 
hours and 50 minutes flight time. 
About 15 minutes prior to the estimated time of arrival at Oksibil the crew of 
another aircraft informed the Twin Otter crew that the weather in the Oksibil area 
was partly cloudy. There were no further reports of radio transmissions from the 
Twin Otter, and it did not arrive at Oksibil. 
A search was initiated at the time the aircraft would have run out of fuel. On the 
morning of 4 August 2009, searchers located the wreckage of the Twin Otter at an 
elevation of about 9,300 feet about 6 Nm from Oksibil. The aircraft was destroyed 
by impact forces, and all of the occupants were fatally injured. 
The pilots did not maintain visual flight procedures when flying below lowest safe

registered PK-ANW, operated by Sekolah Tinggi Penerbangan Indonesia (STPI), 
on a local training flight from Budiarto Airport (Curug), Tangerang, Banten, 
Indonesia, impacted terrain about 13 km southwest of the aerodrome. 
Thunderstorms, strong wind, and heavy rain were in the area at the time. 
There were three persons on board the aircraft; one flight instructor and two 
student pilots. The instructor was fatally injured, and the two student pilots were 
seriously injured. 
The aircraft was airworthy during when it departed from Curug. It was destroyed 
by the impact forces, and the damage to the aircraft was consistent with it being in 
an aerodynamically stalled condition at the time of impact. 
During the investigation it was concluded that there was a lack of supervision and 
instruction from STPI regarding the aircraftâ€™s continued operation in adverse 
weather condition. Those requirements were documented in the STPI operating 
handbooks. 
It was also concluded that the injuries sustained by two of the occupants during the 
impact were the result of them not having properly worn their safety harnesses. 
Other safety issues were identified during the investigation. They included ground based very high frequency radio communication equipment and ground-based wind 
direction indication equipment. Those issues did not contribute to the accident, but

"On the morning of 17 April 2009, a Pilatus PC-6/B2-H4 Turbo Porter aircraft, 
registered PK-LTJ, operated by PT. Mimika Air, charter flight from Ilaga to Mulia 
in the Puncak Jaya District of Papua. The Mimika Local Government owned the 
aircraft. There were 11 people on board; one pilot, one observer, and nine 
passengers comprised of eight adults and one infant. The aircraft was also carrying 
National Government election boxes. 
The flight in accordance with the visual flight rules was estimated to take 18 
minutes. There was no record of communication with the aircraft during the flight. 
Two minutes after the estimated time of arrival, when the Porter had not arrived, a 
search was commenced. On 18 April, search aircraft located the wreckage of the 
Porter at an elevation of about 12,000 feet on Mt Gergaji. The location was on the 
direct track between Ilaga and Mulia. The aircraft impacted the ground in an 
inverted attitude, and was destroyed by the impact forces and the post-impact fire. 
All occupants were fatally injured. 
The weather in the valleys along the route was mostly clear, with cloud on the 
mountains. The route flown by the pilot was the direct track, which passed over a 
mountain range, with a high peak adjacent to, and west of the track at about the 
midway point, at 13,700 feet. 
The investigation determined that it was likely that the pilot had flown the aircraft 
into cloud and lost control of the aircraft in instrument meteorological conditions. 
The impact signature was consistent with uncontrolled flight at the time of impact. 
This probably resulted from the pilot becoming spatially disoriented after entering 
cloud.

scheduled passenger and cargo flight from Sentani Airport to Wamena 
Airport, Papua. The crew consisted of two pilots, two flight attendants, an 
engineer, and a load master. 
The aircraft performed a go-around from the initial landing approach on 
runway 15 at Wamena. The flight crew positioned the aircraft on a right 
downwind leg for another landing approach. As the aircraft was turned 
towards the final approach for the second landing approach at Wamena it 
impacted terrain and was destroyed. All of the occupants were fatally injured. 
The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) manufacturer 
performed simulations using data from the flight recorders, and two separate 
terrain data sources. The manufacturer informed the investigation that â€œthe 
GPWS/EGPWS alerts recorded in the CVR were issued as designedâ€. 
However the enhanced Look-Ahead function appeared to have been inhibited 
following the go around. There was no evidence from the CVR that the crew 
had deliberately inhibited the terrain function of the EGPWS. The 
investigation determined that the EGPWS issued appropriate warnings to the 
flight crew, in the GPWS mode. 
The pilot in command did not take appropriate remedial action in response to 
repeated EGPWS warnings. The investigation concluded that flight crewâ€™s 
lack of awareness of the aircraftâ€™s proximity with terrain, together with non 
conformance to the operatorâ€™s published operating procedures, resulted in the 
aircraftâ€™s impact with terrain. 
As a consequence of this accident, the operator took safety action to address 
deficiencies in its documentation for missed approach procedures at Wamena. 
As a result of this accident, the National Transportation Safety Committee 
(NTSC) also issued safety recommendations to the operator and to the 
Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) to ensure that relevant 
documented safety procedures are implemented. 
During the investigation, safety issues were identified concerning modification 
of aircraft and DGCA approval of those modifications. While those safety 
issues did not contribute to the accident, they nevertheless are safety 
deficiencies. Accordingly, the NTSC report includes recommendations to 
address those identified safety issues.","The investigation concluded that flight crewâ€™s lack of awareness of the aircraftâ€™s proximity with terrain, together with non conformance to the operatorâ€™s published operating procedures, resulted in the aircraftâ€™s impact with terrain.

"On 9 March 2009, a Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft, registered PK-LIL, 
operated by PT. Lion Mentari Airline (Lion Air) as flight number LNI-793, departed 
from Sultan Hasanuddin Airport (WAAA), Makassar, Ujung Pandang, Sulawesi at 
0636 UTC for Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (WIII), Jakarta. The estimated 
flight hour from Makassar to Jakarta was 2 hours. The crew consisted of two pilots 
and four flight attendants. There were 166 adult passengers. 
The copilot was the pilot flying for the sector, and the pilot in command (PIC) was the 
support/monitoring pilot. 
During the approach to runway 25L at Jakarta, the weather at the airport was reported 
as wind direction 200 degrees, wind speed 20 knots, visibility 1,000 meters, and rain. 
The PIC reported that he decided to take over control from the copilot. 
The PIC later reported that he had the runway in sight passing through 1,000 feet on 
descent, and he disengaged the autopilot at 400 feet. At about 50 feet the aircraft 
drifted to the right and the PIC initiated corrective action to regain the centreline. The 
aircraft touched down to the left of the runway 25L centerline and then commenced to 
drift to the right. The PIC reported that he immediately commenced corrective action 
by using thrust reverser, but the aircraft increasingly crabbed along the runway with 
the tail to the right of runway heading. The investigation subsequently found that the 
right thrust reverser was deployed, but left thrust reverser was not deployed. 
The aircraft stopped at 0835 on the right side of the runway 25L, 1,095 meters from 
the departure end of the runway on a heading of 152 degrees; 90 degrees to the 
runway 25L track. The main landing gear wheels collapsed, and still attached to the

"On 23 February 2009, a Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft, registered PK-LIO, 
operated by Lion Air as flight number LNI-972, was scheduled to depart Polonial Airport 
Medan at 16.35 LT (09.35 UTC1
) for Hang Nadim Airport â€“ Batam (Kepulauan Riau). The 
crew consisted of two pilots and four flight attendants. There were 156 passengers; 148 
adults, four children, and four infants. 
After takeoff, during the landing gear up procedure, the pilot noted one red light illuminate 
(nose gear) on the landing gear panel. During the investigation the pilots reported that they 
recycled the landing gear and the subsequent cockpit indication was that the landing gear was 
in the up and locked position. The pilots continued the flight to the planned destination Hang 
Nadim Aiport, Batam. 
During final approach at Batam, the pilots noted that the red light nose gear indicator was 
illuminated. The pilot in command (PIC) decided to conduct a go around and hold to perform 
the emergency checklist to attempt to extend the nose landing gear. After many attempts to 
extend the landing gear, the nose landing gear red indicator light remain illuminated. The PIC 
decided to make an emergency landing on runway 04 without the nose landing gear extended. 
The aircraft subsequently stopped on the runway 04 on the centre line. 
Emergency personnel and vehicles from Hang Nadim Airport prepared for the emergency, 
and laid foam on the runway before the aircraft landed, to eliminate fire hazard. 
The passengers and crew evacuated via the left front door escape slide. None of the occupants 
were injured. 
The initial investigation found that the nose landing gear spray (water) deflector had 
fractured, jamming the nose landing gear in the up position. 
The investigation is continuing and will include the operational procedures used during the 
flight to address the landing gear malfunction, and analysis of the mode of failure of the nose 
landing gear spray deflector.

"On 16 January 2009, a Boeing Company 737-400 aircraft, registered PK-MDO, was 
being operated on an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) scheduled passenger service from 
Sultan Hasanuddin Airport Makassar as flight MZ 762, with an intended destination 
of Frans Kaisiepo Airport, Biak. There were two pilots, five flight attendants, and 164 
passengers on board including 14 infants. 
The co-pilot was intended to be the handling pilot on this sector, while the Pilot in 
Command (PIC) was the support/monitoring pilot. 
The flight was the second flight sector of the day for the pilots and the aircraft, after 
the first departure from Soekarnoâ€“Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Makassar. There was no 
abnormality reported on the first sector. The actual aircraft turn around time at 
Makassar was about 55 minutes prior the next departure. 
The crew taxied out off apron and proceed to runway 31 for departure. There was 
another aircraft taxied out before them. The crew elected to taxi slowly to prevent 
hold on short of runway to give sufficient distance to the traffic ahead. The crew 
successfully managed the taxi speed and entered the runway for departure without 
stopping the aircraft. 
The aircraft had a total takeoff weight of 60,400 kg and was configured for a takeoff 
with flap 5. The V1 for this weight and configuration was 145 knots. 
Weather at the airport was raining and the runway was wet. The crew used full thrust 
take off power. 
The aircraft started to roll for takeoff. The PIC set the takeoff thrust while the co-pilot 
as pilot flying controlled the direction of the aircraft. The PIC call â€œ80â€ to the co-pilot 
as the aircraftâ€™s speed passed 80 knots. At a speed of approximately 125 kts, the PIC 
noticed a vibration on the aircraft and the acceleration discontinued. The PIC elected 
to abort the takeoff by retarding both thrust levers to idle and selecting to reverse 
thrust. The co-pilot reported that he noticed the speed brake lever extended and the 
auto brake disarm light illuminated, while the aircraft speed decelerated through 80 
knots. 
The PIC controlled the aircraft to keep it on the centreline by using the rudder pedal. 
The aircraft decelerated and when it reached the normal taxi speed, the PIC turned the 
aircraft to the left into the runway turning area. He intended to taxi the aircraft back to 
the apron. An airport security officer who was close to the aircraft and witnessed the 
incident, gave a hand signal to the PIC indicating that taxi should not be continued. 
The PIC stopped the aircraft on the runway turning area. Both left tires were severely 
damaged. Both right main wheel tires deflated as the fuses had melted by overheat. 
Part of the left main landing gear door detached.

"On 12 December 2008, a de Havilland DHC 6-300 Twin Otter aircraft, registered PK BRS, was being operated by PT. Aviastar Mandiri on a series of scheduled flights 
from Timika, Papua. 
The last flight of the day was a return flight from Timika to Ewer, about 36 minutes 
each way. The copilot was the handling pilot for the flight sector from Ewer to 
Timika, and the PIC was the support/monitoring pilot. 
The PIC reported that the aircraft commenced sliding before brakes release, and 
shortly after commencing the take-off roll the aircraft veered to the right, so he took 
over control from the copilot. However, he was unable to prevent the aircraft from 
swinging to the left and it rolled through the centreline to the left side of the runway. 
The PIC aborted the take off and attempted to regain the runway centreline from the 
left using nose-wheel steering. That attempt was unsuccessful, and the aircraft veered 
further left and slid off the runway into wet soft ground on the edge of the marsden 
matting runway. It came to a stop 360 meters from the departure end of the runway on 
a heading of 190 degrees. 
The PIC shut down the engines and instructed the copilot to disembark the 
passengers. None of the aircraftâ€™s occupants were injured. 
The investigation was unable to determine why the pilots were unable to maintain 
directional control during the take-off roll. It is likely that in taking control from the 
copilot, and using nose-wheel steering, the PIC may have over corrected, resulting in 
a loss of directional control. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) made recommendations to 
the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to require aircraft operators to 
ensure that airstrips in remote locations have an effective means of communicating 
with regional authorities in the event of an accident or serious incident. 
The NTSC also recommended that the DGCA require Indonesian airport operators to 
inspect the marsden matting runway and ensure that there are no exposed locating 
pins or other objects that could present a hazard to aircraft, and that traction can be 
assured in wet conditions.

"On 6 November 2008, an aircraft Dornier 328-100 TP, registration PK-TXL 
operated by Express Air flight number Express 9000, was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Manado to Fak-Fak, Papua via Sorong. The flight 
departed from Manado at 21:15 UTC (06:15 WIT) with an estimated arrival time at 
Fak-Fak of 01:33 UTC. There were 36 people on board; consist of three pilots, one 
cabin crew, and 32 passengers. 
The aircraft touched down heavily approximately 5 meters before the touch-down 
area of runway 10 at Torea Airport, Fak-Fak at 01:33. The investigation found that 
the left main landing gear touched the ground first (5 meters before the end of the 
runway), and the right main landing gear touched the ground (4.5 meters from the 
end of the runway). 
It stopped on the runway, approximately 700 meters from the touch-down area. The 
left main landing gear fractured in two places; at the front pivot point, and the aft 
pivot point. The left fuselage contacted the runway surface 200 meters from the 
touch-down point and the aircraft slid with the left fuselage on the ground for a 
further 500 meters, before it stopped at the right edge of the runway. The wing tip 
and left propeller blade tips also touched the runway and were damaged. 
The passengers and crew disembarked normally; there were no injuries. 
Following an inspection of the landing gear and temporary replacement of the 
damaged left main landing gear, the aircraft was moved to the apron on 8 November 
2008 at 04:00. The runway was closed for 5 days. 
The Digital Flight Data Recorder data showed evidence that the aircraft descended 
suddenly and rapidly when it was on short final approach. About 65 seconds before 
ground impact, the RPM of both propellers commenced to decrease to approximately 
70% with the NH increasing to 85%. Propeller RPM then suddenly reduced, 
followed by an immediate and rapid increase of propeller RPM to 111% left and 
97% right, then just as sudden and rapid, the left propeller RPM reduced to 77% and 
the right to 80%. Given that the propellers are constant speed units, the sudden and 
rapid changes could not be explained other than the probability that a crew member 
had made the control inputs. 
The PIC (pilot monitoring/flight instructor) did not monitor the operation of the 
aircraft sufficiently to ensure timely and effective response to the pilot induced 
excessive sink rate. 
The pilots did not communicate appropriately during the approach and landing, 
resulting is poor crew resource management (CRM). There was no evidence that any 
of the pilots had completed any form of CRM training for more than 9 years. Other 
than the handling pilot, there was no evidence that the other pilots had completed 
ALAR/CFIT training. 
The operator did not have a Line Operations Safety Audit Program (LOSA), and the 
airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standard with respect to runway end safety 
areas. 
Safety action taken following the accident involved the airport authority raising the 
level of the undershoot area to the same level as the runway, and the aircraft operator 
providing the pilots with further flight training.

None of the aircraftâ€™s occupants were injured and they disembarked normally. 
The investigation found that the worn inner threads of the axle number two (left 
main landing gear) caused the detachment of the axle nut and the separation of the 
wheel from the axle wheel number two. The strength and tightness of the thread 
joint could not be assured by the magnitude of tightening torque. 
The power source to the aircraftâ€™s flight recorders was left on during the ground 
inspection immediately following the serious incident, so all cockpit voice data was 
overwritten and not available to the investigation. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) issued recommendations to 
PT. Wings Abadi Airlines during the investigation to inspect the fleet to ensure the 
serviceability of landing gear axle threads. The NTSC also recommended that the 
airline should promulgate procedures requiring flight crew and maintenance 
personnel to deactivate the power source to flight recorders as soon as practicable 
after an accident or serious incident. The NTSC also urged the DGCA to ensure 
that Indonesian operators have flight recorder deactivation procedures and they are 
implemented.","On 20 October 2008, a Boeing Company Mc Donnell Douglas DC9-82 aircraft, registered PK-LMS, was being operated on a scheduled passenger service from Jakarta Soekarnoâ€“Hatta Airport to Juanda Airport, Surabaya.

"On 27 August 2008, a Boeing 737-200 aircraft, registered PK-CJG, was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger service from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta to Sultan 
Thaha Airport, Jambi with flight number SJY 062. On board on this flight were two pilots, 
four flight attendants, and 124 passengers. 
The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in Command (SIC) 
acted as the Pilot Monitoring (PM). 
The flight time from Jakarta to Jambi estimated about one hour and the aircraft was 
dispatched with approximate for 4 hours of fuel endurance. At 09:18 UTC the SIC contacted 
Thaha Tower controller and reported that the aircraft was descending and passing FL160 and 
has been cleared by Palembang Approach control to descend to 12,000 feet. The PIC flew the 
aircraft direct to intercept the final approach runway 31. While descending through 2500 feet 
and about 8 miles from the VOR, the flap one degree and flap 5Â° were selected. Subsequently 
the landing gear extended and flap 15Â° was selected. 13 seconds after flap 15 selection, the 
pilots noticed that the hydraulic system A low pressure warning light illuminated, and also the 
hydraulic system A quantity indicator showed zero. The PIC continued the approach and 
adived the SIC that he aimed to fly the aircraft slightly below the normal glide path in order to 
get more distance available for the landing roll. 
The aircraft touched down at 0930 UTC , and during the landing roll the PIC had difficulty to 
select the reversers while applying manual braking. The aircraft drifted to the right of the 
runway centre line about 200 meters prior went out of the runway, stopped at about 120 
meters from the end of the runway 31 on a surface 6 meters below the runway surface. Three 
farmers who were working on that area hit by the aircraft and seriously injured. 
All crew and passengers safely evacuated the aircraft. No significant property damage was 
reported 
The SSCVR and SSFDR were good, examined and subsequently downloaded using the ATSB 
facilities. 
The contributing factors were as the following of: 
The Loss of Hydraulic System A occurred requires the pilots to refere the QRH. At the 
time of occurrence, the pilots has sufficient time to do the procedure and determine all 
the consequences prior to land the aircraft. However the pilot did not use the QRH 
which will assist and guide with the detail of procedures and steps to do before decision 
to land was made, therefore the KNKT recommends that the operator shall ensure that 
pilots when facing the non normal situation should use the QRH and other references 
procedures. 
Crew Resource Management is the application of team management concepts and the 
effective use of all available resources to operate a flight safely and in addition to the 
vi crew, it includes all other groups routinely working with the aircrew are involved in 
decision required to operate a flight. In fact, there was no discussion concerning to the 
non normal situation as described on the CRM before decision to land was made.

"On the Saturday 9 August 2008, a Pilatus Porter PC-6 B2-H4 aircraft, registered PK RCZ, operated by AMA (Association of Mission Aviation) departed from Taive II for 
NduNdu, Papua, The flight was to be operated in accordance with the visual flight 
rules (VFR), remaining clear of cloud and navigating visually. 
The aircraft did not arrive at NduNdu and pilots of search aircraft reported hearing 
PK-RCZâ€™s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal, but were unable to reach the 
crash site due to the weather conditions. 
At 2020 (0520 local time on Sunday 10 August), the aircraft wreckage was found at

"On 23 July 2008, a Boeing 737-400 aircraft, registered PK-GZN, was being operated 
on a scheduled passenger service from Soekarnoâ€“Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Syamsudin 
Noor Airport, Banjarmasin. There were 121 persons on board; two pilots, five flight 
attendants, and 114 passengers including one child and two infants. 
The pilots reported that the touchdown was normal. When the aircraft slowed to about 
60 knots, the pilot in command (PIC) applied manual braking and shortly after, the 
ANTI SKID INOP light illuminated. The PIC then performed the standard memory 
items of the Emergency Check List, and continued taxiing to the apron. As the PIC 
turned the aircraft to the right to enter taxiway B he heard a sound that he associated 
with a tire bursting, so he stopped the aircraft. 
Engineers who inspected the aircraft on the apron, prior to the passengers 
disembarking, informed the PIC that the number-one main landing gear axle was 
broken, and detached from its strut. The number-two tire had burst. 
None of the aircraftâ€™s occupants were injured, and they disembarked normally using 
airstairs. 
The investigation found that an undetected fatigue crack in the number-one main 
landing gear axle had originated from a corroded hole in the brake assembly 
attachment flange. The fatigue crack propagated toward the flange and the axle wall, 
reaching a length of about 6 cm before a fast final fracture occurred. 
On 5 August 2008, the operatorâ€™s maintenance organization issued engineering orders 
that required increased inspection schedules for Boeing 737 main landing gear axles,

"On 1 June 2008, an Airbus A320 aircraft, registration PK-YVE, was being 
operated by Metro Batavia Airlines (Batavia Air) flight number 7P-591, on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Jakarta to Medan. The flight departed at 00:10 UTC 
(07:10 local time) with an estimated arrival time at Medan of 02:25. There were 140 
people on board; two pilots, five cabin crew, and 133 passengers. 
The aircraft touched down towards the departure end of the touch-down area of 
runway 05 at Polonia Airport, Medan at 03:04. After a landing run of 41 seconds, the 
aircraft stopped on the runway adjacent to taxiway â€˜Dâ€™, approximately 1,200 meters 
from the estimated point of touch down. Three main-wheel tires and two main 
wheels were substantially damaged. The aircraft could not be taxied from the runway 
to the apron, nor could it be towed to the apron due to damage to the wheels. 
The passengers and crew disembarked normally at taxiway â€˜Dâ€™; there were no 
injuries. 
Following an inspection of the landing gear and replacement of the damaged wheels, 
the aircraft was towed to the apron at 10:10. The runway was closed for about 7 
hours. 
The investigation found that the left landing gear down-lock cable was broken. The 
aircraft touched down with the wheel brakes locked due to a hydraulic lock in the 
system, which was the result of an incorrect manual landing gear extension 
procedure being used by the pilots. 
The pilotsâ€™ actions indicated that they did not sufficiently understand the aircraftâ€™s 
landing gear system, resulting in them using inappropriate trouble shooting and 
rectification procedures. 
The pilots were not sufficiently confident of the aircraftâ€™s fuel state to conduct a go 
around and fly past as cleared by ATC.

"On 18 April 2008, at 1115 UTC, a Boeing B737-300 aircraft, registered PK CJC operated by PT. Sriwijaya Air, was being flown on a scheduled flight from 
Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang. During the landing at Pangkal Pinang, the aircraft overran 
the end of the runway. The aircraft stopped 50 meters beyond the end of the runway, 
but within the stop-way. 
There were 150 people on board; two pilots, four flight attendants, and 144 
passengers. The aircraftâ€™s occupants were not injured, and disembarked normally 
using air stairs one hour after the aircraft stopped. Based upon crew interviewed, 
airport fire and rescue personnel arrived at the aircraft approximately 10 minutes after 
it stopped. During that 10 minute period, the flight crew were not aware of the extent 
of the damage to the aircraft and if a fire may have started. 
The PIC became distracted by a cabin issue during the approach, and did not 
appropriately monitor the aircraftâ€™s approach profile. The investigation found that the 
aircraft was high and fast on the approach, but the pilot in command allowed the co 
pilot to continue the approach and landing. 
The investigation determined that the approach was un-stabilized, and the flight 
crewâ€™s compliance with procedures, including crew resource management, was not at 
a level to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee issued several recommendations to 
the aircraft operator and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation with the final 
report. These included: a review of airline procedures and flight crew training with 
respect to the timeliness of evacuation of passengers and crew after an accident or 
serious incident, particularly when the extent of damage to the aircraft is not known; a 
review of training programs and procedures with respect to stabilized approaches; and 
the promulgation of procedures requiring flight crew and maintenance personnel to 
deactivate the power source to flight recorders as soon as practicable after an accident 
or serious incident. The NTSC also urged the DGCA to ensure that Indonesian 
operators have flight recorder deactivation procedures and they are implemented. 
The NTSC also reiterated its recommendations that were previously issued to the

similar safety concerns. ","The investigation determined that the approach was un-stabilized, and the flight crewâ€™s compliance with procedures, including crew resource management, was not at a level to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. These included: a review of airline procedures and flight crew training with respect to the timeliness of evacuation of passengers and crew after an accident or serious incident, particularly when the extent of damage to the aircraft is not known; a review of training programs and procedures with respect to stabilized approaches; and the promulgation of procedures requiring flight crew and maintenance personnel to deactivate the power source to flight recorders as soon as practicable after an accident or serious incident","On 18 April 2008, a Boeing B737-300 aircraft overran the runway during a scheduled flight from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang.

"On 6 March 2008, a Transall C-160 aircraft, registered PK-VTQ, 
operated by PT. Manunggal Air, was on an unscheduled freight flight 
from Sentani Airport, Jayapura, to Wamena Airport, Papua. There were 
six people on board; two pilots, one flight engineer, one AME (Aircraft 
Maintenance Engineer), one Mechanic, one FOO (Flight Operation 
Officer). 
The Beta lights did not illuminate during the landing roll at Wamena, so 
reverse thrust could not be used. The pilots used maximum brake action 
to slow the aircraft, and rolled through to the end of runway 15, then 
backtracked the aircraft towards taxiway â€œEâ€, about 450 meters from the 
departure end of runway 15. 
The air traffic controller informed the Transall crew that heavy smoke 
was coming from the left main-wheels, and activated the crash alarm. The 
pilots stopped the aircraft on taxiway â€œEâ€, and the occupants disembarked 
and attempted to extinguish the wheel-bay fire with a hand held 
extinguisher. 
The airport rescue fire fighting service (RFFS) took 15 minutes to 
commence applying foam to the fire. The attempts to extinguish the fire 
were unsuccessful, and the fire destroyed the aircraft and its cargo of fuel 
in drums. 
The investigation determined that the left main wheelsâ€™ brakes overheated 
during the landing roll. Due to the extreme fire damage, the investigation 
was not able to determine the condition of the brake pads at the time of 
the landing, and if that may have contributed to the overheating. 
A fire commenced in the brake area of one or more of the left main 
landing gear wheels. Sections of the left aft main wheelsâ€™, inner and outer 
brake disks were substantially damaged, with sections missing; burnt 
away. The investigation was unable to determine the location of the 
source of the fire propellant. It is likely that brake system hydraulic fluid 
under pressure, was the propellant that fed the fire. 
The National Transportation Safety Committeeâ€™s report includes 
recommendations to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address 
safety deficiencies to ensure compliance with ICAO Annex 14 
Standards. The safety deficiencies are with respect to the status of the

"On the morning of 30 January 2008, a de Havilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft, 
registered PK-BRP, was being operated by PT. Aviastar Mandiri Airlines on a charter 
flight carrying passengers and cargo from Nabire to Sugapa, via Enarotali, Papua. 
There were 18 persons on board; two pilots, one engineer, and 15 passengers. The 
pilot in command (PIC) was the handling pilot, and the co-pilot was the 
monitoring/support pilot. 
Sugapa weather was clear, with the surface wind calm. The PIC made the approach to 
runway 27 at Sugapa. 
Shortly after touchdown, the aircraft veered to the left and the PIC was unable to 
maintain directional control to keep the aircraft on the runway. The aircraft left the 
runway and struck and fatally injured a man standing close to the edge of the runway. 
The right main wheel sank into soft ground and the aircraft swung abruptly to the 
right through 270 degrees, tearing the nose landing gear from the aircraft. It stopped 
with the nose embedded in an embankment 5 meters from the side of the runway. 
The aircraft was substantially damaged, but the occupants were not injured and 
vacated the aircraft unaided. 
The pilot in command indicated that the aircraft had a history of a tendency to veer to 
left during ground roll. However, investigation found no pre-landing defects with the 
aircraft that could have contributed to the accident. There was also no record of such a 
defect being entered in the aircraft maintenance log. 
The investigation found that the nose landing gear fork cracked and was deformed as 
a result of being subjected to a high impact force during the touchdown.

The Merauke air traffic controller reported that when the aircraft was on final 
approach there were no obstructions on the runway, so he cleared the aircraft to 
land on runway 16. 
During the landing roll, the pilot observed that a cow had entered the active 
runway and was running across the runway in front of the aircraft. When the 
aircraft was about 1,000 meters from the runway 16 threshold, the left engine 
struck the cow. The pilots stopped the aircraft on the runway and shut down the 
left engine. The cabin crew informed the pilots that left engine cowling was 
damaged. 
The aircraftâ€™s occupants were not injured, and disembarked from the aircraft 
unaided, using air stairs at the apron. 
The investigation found that the airport did not meet the requirements of ICAO 
Annex 14, Volume 1, Paragraph 9.10.2, Standard, or the intent of Civil Aviation 
Safety Regulation (CASR) 139 Subparts 4.2 and 4.12.

"An agriculture aircraft of the Fletcher FU-24-950 type, registered as PK-PNB and owned by Sinar Mas Super Air, conducted routine aerial fertilization tasks on December 11, 2007, in the Cendrawasih Estate oil palm plantation, Sentani - Papua.

A pre-flight check was conducted before takeoff, and no damage or abnormalities were found. The aircraft began its flight at 7:45 AM local time and commenced the fertilizer spreading operation. The loading of fertilizer into the aircraft during the first to the tenth flights proceeded without any issues.

However, during the loading for the eleventh flight, the aircraft took off and experienced an accident at 9:30 AM in the K19 L20 block area. Shortly after the accident, staff from the agronomy/plantation department reported the incident to the technicians in the hangar.

As the aircraft was heading to the fertilization point in the H-20 area and maneuvering at very low altitude, the left wing of the aircraft struck the oil palm trees. This resulted in the left wing breaking and subsequently causing the aircraft to crash.

Due to the accident, the pilot lost their life at the scene of the incident.","Sebuah pesawat terbang pertanian (agriculture aircraft) jenis Fletcher FU-24-950 milik Sinar Mas Super Air dengan registrasi PK-PNB tanggal 11 Desember 2007 melakukan tugas rutin menebar pupuk dari udara di perkebunan kelapa sawit Cendrawasih Estate, Sentani - Papua.

Airport, Poso City, Central Sulawesi. The aircraft departed from Makassar at 00:45 
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and arrived at Kasiguncu at 01:55. There were 6 
occupants; 1 pilot and 5 passengers. 
During the landing on runway 21, the aircraft travelled normally for about 200 meters and 
then suddenly diverged left causing the propeller to strike the runway. Numerous slash marks 
from the three-bladed propeller were found for a distance of 100 meters on the runway. The 
left wing subsequently struck the runway, causing the aircraft to continue turning left through 
90 degrees. The aircraft stopped on the grass shoulder of runway 21. 
The airportâ€™s rescue fire fighting vehicle had been unserviceable since it was damaged during 
riots in 2004. Airport personnel went immediately to the accident site to offer assistance and 
brought portable fire fighting equipment. There was no fire. The pilot and his 5 passengers

"On 16 November 2007, a Cessna 172 aircraft operated by Admal SDN. 
BHD Malaysia, registered 9M-BDI, departed from Hang Nadim Airport, 
Batam, on a ferry flight to Pangkal Pinang (Depati Amir) Airport, Indonesia. 
There were two persons on board. The flight had originated at Subang 
Airport, Selangor, Malaysia and tracked via Johor Bahru and Batam, landing 
at each airport, but only refueling at Batam. 
About an hour after departure from Batam, the pilot reported climbing above 
1,500 feet, and 3 minutes later the pilot broadcast a MAYDAY, stating that 
he was looking for a place to land. At that time he reported that he was 49 
miles from Pangkal Pinang and passing 7,500 feet. The pilot did not give a 
reason for the Mayday broadcast until 5 minutes later. He said that he had 
found a place to land, and then made a passing reference to a fuel leak, and 
that he would refuel and take off from the landing position. The aircraft was 
carrying three jerry cans of avgas in the passenger cabin. 
The pilot subsequently landed on a beach 42 NM north west of Pangkal 
Pinang. During the landing roll the nose wheel sank into soft sand and 
collapsed, resulting in the aircraft overturning. 
The pilotâ€™s passing reference to refuelling and taking off from the forced 
landing position, indicated that following the forced landing he intended to 
refuel from the on-board jerry cans of avgas, and take off from the beach. It 
was evident that the pilot knew that the engine had failed due to fuel 
exhaustion. 
The pilot informed the investigators that he had not leaned the fuel mixture 
during the climb to, and subsequent cruise at 9,000 feet. The investigation 
determined that the pilot did not operate the aircraft in accordance with the 
engine leaning procedures specified by the operator and the aircraft 
manufacturer. If the pilot had used the same procedures for the flight sectors 
from Subang to Johore Bahru and Batam, it is likely that after refueling at 
Batam there was considerably less fuel in the aircraftâ€™s wing tanks than 
estimated by the pilot. 
The investigation determined that under the operating procedures used by the 
pilot, the aircraft did not have sufficient useable fuel on board to complete 
the planned flight when it departed from Batam.

on a scheduled passenger flight from Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, 
Jakarta, was substantially damaged as a result of a severe hard landing sequence at 
Abdurrachman Saleh Airport, Malang, East Java. There were 94 persons on board 
the aircraft, consisting of two pilots, three cabin crew, and 89 passengers. 
The investigation determined that the crew did not refer to the aircraft rate of 
descent when it exceeded 1,000 feet/minute during the landing approach, and was 
therefore an unstabilized approach condition. 
The investigation also determined that the PIC did not respond appropriately to the 
any of ground proximity warning system voice â€˜aural warnings that were initiated 
during the latter stages of the approach as a result of the high rate of descent of the

The aircraft bounced to a height of about 20 feet after the initial hard landing, but no attempt was made to recover. Mandala Airlines issued a Safety Quality Notice to all pilots, addressing safety deficiencies in flight crew training for unstabilized approaches."
"On 2 September 2007, a Casa 212-200 aircraft, registered PK-NCN, operated by PT. Merpati

"On Friday 1 June 2007, a de Havilland Twin Otter DHC 6-300, registered PK-YRU 
overran the right side of the runway during the take-off roll. The aircraft left the runway 
and impacted a ditch and rocks on the right shoulder of the runway. Main-wheel tire marks 
for more than 65 meters on the runway indicated that heavy braking action was being 
applied to the left brake. 
A witness statement confirmed the tire track evidence on the runway, that during the early 
take-off roll the aircraft turned right, then left, and then back to the right before leaving the 
runway. The aircraft was substantially damaged. None of the occupants were injured. 
The handling pilot was undergoing captaincy training under the supervision of an 
instructor.
The investigation was unable to determine why the aircraft commenced veering to the right 
during the early acceleration phase of the takeoff. The pilots continued the takeoff and 
directional control was lost during the take-off roll. The instructor pilot was unable to 
regain directional control of the aircraft before it left the runway.
No aircraft or system defect was found that could have contributed to the pilotsâ€™ inability 
to maintain directional control during the take-off roll. 
The pilot under training stated that â€œthings happened fastâ€ and he was â€œunaware that the 
power levers were still in the full on positionâ€, but was â€œconscious that his left hand was 
on the steering handleâ€. He said that he did not immediately respond to a shout from the 
instructor to not use the steering handle. 
The investigation considered that it was possible that the nose-wheel steering was not 
centred before commencing the take-off roll and that the pilot under training may have 
been unaware that he was holding an inappropriate nose-wheel steering position during the 
take-off roll. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee made a recommendation to the Directorate

"On 7 March 2007, a Boeing Company 737-497 aircraft, registered PK-GZC, was 
being operated by Garuda Indonesia on an instrument flight rules (IFR), scheduled 
passenger service, as flight number GA200 from Soekarno-Hatta Airport, Jakarta to 
Adi Sucipto Airport, Yogyakarta. There were two pilots, five flight attendants, and 
133 passengers on board. 
The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 
at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. Yogya Approach cleared the 
aircraft for a visual approach, with a requirement to proceed to long final and report 
runway in sight. Although the crew acknowledged the visual approach clearance, they 
continued with the ILS approach, but did not inform the controller. The descent and 
approach were conducted in visual meteorological conditions. 
At 23:55:33, when the aircraft was 10.1 miles from the runway, it was 1,427 feet 
above the initial fix of 2,500 feet published in the approach chart, and the airspeed was 
283 knots. The pilot in command descended the aircraft steeply in an attempt to reach 
the runway, but in doing so, the airspeed increased excessively. Because the aircraft 
was being flown at speeds that were in excess of the wing flaps operation speed, the 
copilot elected not to extend the flaps as instructed by the PIC. During the approach, 
the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times 
and the copilot called for the PIC to go around. 
The PIC continued the approach with flaps 5 degrees, and the aircraft attained the 
glideslope near the runway 09 threshold. Flaps 5 degrees is not a landing flap setting. 
The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 
knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The wind 
was north easterly at 9 knots. The groundspeed was 235 knots. The aircraft touched 
down at an airspeed of 221 knots, 87 knots faster than landing speed for 40 degrees 
flap. Shortly after touching down, the copilot called, with high intonation, for the PIC 
to go around. 
The aircraft was flown at an excessive airspeed and steep flight path angle during the 
approach and landing, resulting in an unstabilized approach. The PIC did not follow 
company procedures that required him to fly a stabilized approach, and he did not 
abort the landing and go around when the approach was not stabilized.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviationâ€™s flying operations surveillance of Garuda was 
not effective in identifying these and other safety deficiencies. 
The Yogyakarta Airportâ€™s rescue and fire fighting services vehicles were unable to reach 
the accident site and some did not have appropriate fire suppressant. The delay in 
extinguishing the fire, and the lack of appropriate fire suppressant agents, may have 
significantly reduced survivability. The airport emergency plan and its implementation 
were less than effective. 

A number of safety actions by Angkasa Pura I to address safety deficiencies with respect to 
airport emergency preparedness and associated services and equipment are also included. 
Since the accident, an access road between the airport perimeter and the area of the 
accident site has been constructed. 
On 2 April 2007, Garuda issued a notice to its pilots reinforcing its mandatory policy 
relating to a pilot monitoring to take control of an aircraft and execute a go around in

scheduled passenger flight from Surabaya (SUB), East Java to Manado (MDC), Sulawesi, 
at FL 350 (35,000 feet) when it disappeared from radar. 
The aircraft departed from Djuanda Airport, Surabaya at 05:59 Coordinated Universal Time 
(UTC) under the instrument flight rules (IFR), with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) at 
Sam Ratulangi Airport, Manado of 08:14. The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying 
for the sector to Manado and the copilot was the monitoring/support pilot. There were 102 
people on board; two pilots, 4 cabin crew, and 96 passengers comprised of 85 adults, 7 
children and 4 infants. 
The Indonesian Navy, Army, Air Force, Police, and Search and Rescue organization, a 
Singaporean Air Force Fokker 50 aircraft, the USNS Mary Sears, National Transportation 
Safety Committee of Indonesia, Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore, 
Singapore Navy Divers, and other resources searched for the wreckage of PK-KKW in the 
Makassar Strait, in the vicinity of the last radar return. 
Nine days after the aircraft disappeared, wreckage was found in the water and on the shore 
along the coast near Pare-Pare, Sulawesi. Locator beacon signals from the flight recorders 
were heard on 21 January 2007 and their positions logged. The attempt to recover the 
recorders was suspended when it was determined that the wreckage was located in the 
ocean at a depth of about 2,000 meters, requiring specialized recovery equipment not 
available in the Region. The DFDR data showed that roll rate was momentarily arrested several times, but there was 
only one significant attempt to arrest the roll. Positive and sustained roll attitude recovery 
was not achieved. Even after the aircraft had reached a bank angle of 100 degrees, with the 
pitch attitude approaching 60 degrees aircraft nose down, the pilot did not roll the aircraftâ€™s 
wings level before attempting pitch recovery in accordance with standard operating 
procedures. The aircraft reached 3.5g, as the speed reached Mach 0.926 during sustained 
nose-up elevator control input while still in a right bank. The recorded airspeed exceeded 
Vdive (400 kcas), and reached a maximum of approximately 490 kcas just prior to the end 
of recording. A thump, thump sound was evident on the CVR about 20 seconds from the end of the 
recorded data. Flight recorder data indicated that a significant structural failure occurred 
when the aircraft was at a speed of Mach 0.926 and the flight load suddenly and rapidly 
reversed from 3.5g to negative 2.8 g. This g force and airspeed are beyond the design 
limitations of the aircraft. At the time of the thump, thump sound, the aircraft was in a 
critically uncontrollable state. 
The PIC did not manage task sharing and crew resource management practices were not 
followed. There was no evidence that the pilots were appropriately controlling the aircraft, 
even after the BANK ANGLE alert sounded as the aircraftâ€™s roll exceeded 35 degrees right 
bank. 
This accident resulted from a combination of factors, including the failure of the pilots to 
adequately monitor the flight instruments, particularly during the final 2 minutes of the 
flight. Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System (IRS) diverted 
both pilotsâ€™ attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and 
bank angle to go unnoticed. The pilots did not detect and appropriately arrest the descent 
soon enough to prevent loss of control.
