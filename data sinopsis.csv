Republic of Indonesia 
","On 22 July 2019, a Cessna 172S registered PK-WUG was being operated by Angkasa
Aviation Academy (AAA) on a mutual flight training exercise from Cakrabhuwana Airport 
(WICD), Cirebon to Indramayu Training Area. The flight plan was filed with cruising altitude 
of 2,000 feet. The exercise for the student pilot was on C-14 Stage which contained exercises 
of mutual precision rate one turns, compass error and performance maneuvers.
Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction. On board 
the aircraft were two student pilots and one of the students acted as Pilot in Command (PIC)
while the other student pilot seated on the right seat. 
At 1358 LT, the PK-WUG aircraft departed from Cirebon to the Indramayu Training Area. 
The Global Positioning System (GPS) installed in the aircraft recorded that when the aircraft 
was flying over the southern boundary of the Indramayu Training Area, the aircraft was 
descending. At 1425 LT, the aircraft flew westerly and was descending passed 750 feet.
The aircraft continued descend and while flew over the Cimanuk River passed 140 feet. 
About one minute flying over the river, the aircraft struck power line cables and crashed into
the river.
After the aircraft stopped, both pilots self-evacuated from the aircraft and helped by local 
people to the river bank. During the evacuation, the Safety Pilot was drowned and fatally 
injured while the PIC had minor injury. 
The investigation determined that the aircraft serviceability was not issue in this accident. The 
investigation concluded the contributing factor of the accident was: 
The available means to monitor flight training activities that had not been utilized 
resulted in the aircraft flying below the minimum safe altitude was undetected.
Flying the aircraft below the minimum safe altitude and unaware of the power line cables 
ran across the river made the aircraft struck three power line cables.

","On 25 May 2019, an Airbus A320 aircraft registered PK-LZJ was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport (WAAA), Makassar 
to Mopah International Airport (WAKK), Merauke. On board the aircraft was two pilots, five 
flight attendants and 82 passengers. 
At 1842 UTC (0242 LT), on night time, the aircraft commenced pushback from stand B1. The 
push back operation used towing tractor with the three crews consisted of towing tractor 
driver, a wing-man and a headset-man who performed by an aircraft mechanic. There was no 
briefing among the crew related to the pushback activity including the push back maneuver. 
The towing tractor driver and wing-man used high visibility vest while the headset-man used 
company uniform without any fluorescence strip or high visibility vest. 
The push back maneuver did not follow the guideline and the headset-man walked behind the 
nose wheel while observing the engine start process. During a turn, the aircraft nose wheel 
passed over the right foot of the headset-man. The towing tractor driver felt a bump and 
noticed that the headset-man laid on the ground. The headset-man evacuated to the nearest 
hospital for medical treatment and found sustaining fracture on his right tarsometatarsal.
The investigation determined that the aircraft and towing tractor airworthiness serviceability, 
and communication transmission were not an issue on this occurrence. Therefore, the analysis 
discussed the pushback operation and personnel awareness. The investigation concluded the 
contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:
The different assumption of pushback maneuver between headset-man and the push back 
tractor driver, and both were fixated to their own duties while working on a reduced 
alertness condition, resulted in the towing tractor driver did not aware of the headset-man 
position and the headset-man did not aware of the nose wheel position. These conditions led 
to the nose wheel passed over the headset-man foot.

","On 11 August 2018, a PAC 750XL aircraft registered PK-HVQ was being operated by PT. 
Marta Buana Abadi (Dimonim Air) on unscheduled passenger flight from Tanah Merah to 
Oksibil. At the day of the occurrence the meteorological condition at Oksibil was below the 
requirement of Visual Flight Rule (VFR) weather minima and did not improve. Being aware 
that some flights had performed flight to Tanah Merah to Oksibil and returned, the pilot 
decided to fly to Oksibil. 
At 1342 LT, on daylight condition the PK-HVQ aircraft departed from Tanah Merah to 
Oksibil, on board the aircraft were one pilot, one observer pilot and 7 passengers. According 
to the passenger and cargo manifest, the total weight of passenger and the baggage were 473 
kg. Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction.
At 1411 LT, the PK-HVQ pilot made initial contact to Oksibil Tower controller and reported 
that the aircraft was maintaining altitude of 7,000 feet over and the estimate time arrival at 
Oksibil would be 0520 UTC (1420 LT). The Oksibil Tower controller advised the pilot of the 
latest meteorological condition that the visibility was 1 up to 2 km and most of the area were 
covered by cloud.
At 1416 LT, the pilot reported that the aircraft position was over Oksibil Aiport and the 
Oksibil Tower controller instructed the pilot to continue the flight to the final runway 11 and 
to report when the runway had in sight.
The Oksibil Tower controller and pilots of other aircraft called the pilot but no reply. On the 
following day, the aircraft was found on a ridge of mountain about 3.8 Nm north west of 
Oksibil on bearing 331° with elevation about 6,800 feet. Eight occupants were fatally injured 
and one occupant was seriously injured. 
Investigation involved Transport Accident Investigation Commission of New Zealand and 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada that assigned accredited representative according to 
the ICAO Annex 13.
The investigation determined the contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:
VFR weather minimum requirement that was not implemented properly most likely had 
made the pilot did not have a clear visual to the surrounding area. 
Considering that the Pilot in Command (PIC) had lack knowledge of the terrain 
surrounding the Oksibil area, and the absence of voice alert from the TAWS when the 
aircraft flying close to terrain, resulted in the PIC did not have adequate awareness to the 
surrounding terrain while flying into clouds and continued to fly below the terrain height 
until the aircraft impacted the terrain.
The KNKT acknowledged the safety action taken by the related parties and considered the 
actions were relevant to improve safety, however, there still remain safety issues that need to 
be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations addressed to the 
Dimonim Air, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), and Badan Meteorologi 
Klimatologi dan Geofisika/Bureau of Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG).

Airport (WAHL) Cilacap, Indonesia.
Several days before the accident the student pilot had injured to left hand wrist and the student 
pilot did not report the injury to the flying school nor the flight instructor. The ‘Internal 
Cockpit’ checklist, the pilot required to ensure the fuel selector valve was selected to the Left 
Tank. Subsequently, the ‘Before Take-off’ checklist required the pilots to move the fuel 
selector to the Right Tank. The injury impaired the ability to operate the fuel selector as 
required by the checklist.
At 0030 UTC (0730 LT), the student pilot conducted pre-flight check to the aircraft. The 
student pilot stated that the aircraft was normal and the fuel uplifted was about 190 litres. 
At 0831 LT, the aircraft was lining-up and took off from runway 31. After the aircraft 
airborne, about 300 feet the instructor pilot noticed the engine sound was spooling down. The 
instructor pilot advanced the throttle to increase the engine power however, the engine RPM 
did not increase. Thereafter, the instructor pilot also reached the fuel selector valve with the 
intention to change the fuel selector valve position but the engine RPM continued spooling 
down and the engine quit.
The instructor pilot decided to conduct the force landing on an open area. The instructor pilot 
took the aircraft control and declared mayday due to engine quit with the intention to make 
emergency landing. The controller noticed the aircraft turn right until disappeared behind the 
trees. During descend to the open area, the instructor pilot attempted to restart the engine
without success.
The aircraft landed on paddy field about 1.3 Nm from the beginning of runway 31, on the 
north of the airport. Both pilots survived and self-evacuated the aircraft. The aircraft was 
substantially damage.
The engine ground run test found that if the selection of fuel selector performed more than 3 
seconds after the engine hesitation, the engine would remain hesitation and quit because of the 
engine has been decelerating significantly and the engine unable to suck the fuel from the 
carburettor. The engine ground run test also found that after the fuel in the engine fuel line 
system was exhausted, the engine restart attempt would be success after minimum of 5 restart 
attempts.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors in this occurrence are:
1. The injured left wrist arm might have result to improper selection of the fuel selector 
valve and led to insufficient fuel to the engine during the take-off power resulted in the 
engine hesitation and quit.
2. The engine recovery and restart attempt were unsuccessful that might be due to the time 
availability and the insufficient aircraft altitude.
The KNKT had not received any safety action taken. The KNKT issued safety 
recommendations to the flying school to address safety issues identified in this report. "

by PT. Trigana Air Service on a scheduled cargo flight from Sentani Airport, Jayapura 
(WAJJ) to Wamena Airport, Wamena (WAVV), Papua, Indonesia. On board the aircraft were 
two pilots and one Flight Operation Officer (FOO) as a loadmaster. The flight carried 14,913
kg of cargo. 
The aircraft cruised at altitude 18,000 feet and prior to descend, the pilot observed the weather 
within the criteria of Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC). The pilots able to identify the 
other Trigana flight from Sentani to Wamena in front of them.
The aircraft make orbit in point X which located at 8 Nm from runway 15 to provide 
separation with the aircraft ahead. The aircraft was on sequence number three for landing.
The aircraft ahead safely landed and made the pilot confidence that safe landing would be 
able to be made on the existing weather condition.
About 2,000 feet above airport elevation, the descend approach continued while the weather 
did not meet the visual minima. The pilot reduced the rate of descend twice during the 
descend approach. 
About 1,000 feet above airport elevation, the PM informed to the PF that runway was not in 
sight and advised to go around. About 500 feet above airport elevation, the PF was able to see 
the runway and increased the rate of descend. The pilot noticed that the Enhanced Ground 
Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) aural warning “SINK RATE” active. 
The aircraft touched down approximately 125 meters from the beginning runway 15 with 
vertical acceleration of 3.25 g, the aircraft speed 137 knots, pitch 7° up and roll to the left 5°. 
The calculation of FDR data showed that the rate of descend prior to touch down was 2,300 
feet/minute which was greater than the requirement described on the CASR Part 25.473
Several indications of weather below the visual approach minima, un-stabilized approach, the 
PM suggestion to go around, EGPWS warning, and absence of landing clearance did not 
make the pilot decided to go around. The pilot was sure that he could land the aircraft as the 
previous flight landed safely. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to the accident was refer to the 
previous aircraft that was landed safely, the pilot confidence that a safe landing could be made 
and disregarding several conditions required for go around
Following the accident, the aircraft operator had taken several safety actions. The Komite 
Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) acknowledged the safety actions taken by the 
aircraft operator and considered relevant to prevent similar occurrence. However, KNKT

","Demak, Central Java","On 20 June 2016, a Cessna C172 aircraft registered PK-NIV was being operated by Nusa 
Flying School on a mutual flight training area from Ahmad Yani International Airport 
(WAHS), Semarang to Wedung area, Demak. 
Before commencing the flight, the student pilots conducted preflight check and there was no 
abnormality of the aircraft systems detected. The fuel quantity indicator indicated 120 liters of 
fuel which was sufficient for two-hour flight. No additional fuel tanked at Semarang. 
At 1249 LT (0549 UTC), the aircraft departed from Semarang with two student pilots on 
board which one of the student pilot acted as Pilot Flying (PF), the other acted as Pilot 
Monitoring (PM). The flight from departure until Wedung Area was uneventful. 
After conducted area training exercise for approximately 55 minutes, the pilots were about to 
return to Semarang and was instructed to hold over Wedung Area and maintain 1,000 feet as 
there was an aircraft returning from Jepara Area to Semarang at altitude 2,000 feet.
While holding, the pilot noticed engine problem indicated by decreasing of the propeller 
rotation and aircraft vibration. The pilot performed procedure for identifying the cause and 
checked the ignition position on BOTH, master switch was ON, carburetor heater on position 
STAND BY, mixture on FULL RICH position and the fuel valve selector was slightly on the 
right of ON/BOTH position. 
The pilot was unable to restart the engine by cranking several times and then elected to make 
emergency landing. The PM then informed to the Semarang Approach controller that they 
were making emergency landing. Another training aircraft then relayed to the Semarang 
Approach controller that PK-NIV performed emergency landing on Wedung Area.
At approximately 0636 UTC, the aircraft landed in a fishpond on Wedung Area, at coordinate 
648’5.64” S 11035’0.66” E, at approximate 16 NM from Semarang on radial 050°.
Both student pilots evacuated with minor injury. The aircraft was substantially damaged. The 
fishpond was contaminated with aircraft fuel.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this accident were:
 The engine failure in flight was caused by improper fuel flow to the engine as the fuel 
selector valve was on intermediate position between BOTH and RIGHT.
 The deviation of understanding to the fuel system had caused the engine failure inflight 
and did not reselect to the proper position when performing check for cause procedure 
and resulted in the failure to restart the engine.
Prior to publish this investigation report, KNKT has been informed safety actions taken by 
Nusa Flying Institute. 
The KNKT issued several safety recommendations to Nusa Flying Institute and Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to address safety issues identified during the investigation.

Republic of Indonesia","On 1 May 2016, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft registered PK-LJR was being operated by PT. 
Lion Mentari Airlines. The aircraft parked at parking stand A33 of Soekarno-Hatta 
International Airport, Jakarta and prepared to continue the flight to Manado as LNI770.
At 1150 UTC (1850 LT), it was dusk light condition, the LNI770 aircraft pushed back from 
parking stand A33 heading to taxiway SC3. The pilot aware that their position was behind an 
Airbus A330 aircraft that was pushing back from parking stand K13 and also heading to 
taxiway SC3. 
The Airbus A330 aircraft registered PK-LEF was being operated by the same company as a 
schedule passenger flight with flight number LNI026 from Jakarta with intended destination 
of Ngurah Rai International Airport, Bali. At 1151 UTC (1851 LT), the LNI026 aircraft
pushed back heading to taxiway SC3 was about to start the engines.
Weather condition at that time was fine and the ground visibility was nine kilometers.
During taxi, the LNI770 pilot deviated to the right from the taxi guideline with intention to 
avoid collision with LNI026. When the LNI770 aircraft position was abeam LNI026 the 
LNI770 pilot felt the aircraft shaking and heard unusual sound.
At that time, the LNI026 pilot just completed engine starting and felt the aircraft shaking. The 
pilots check engine parameters were normal and observed that the LNI770 aircraft was taxiing 
on the right side at position that was very close to the LNI026 aircraft.
The LNI026 pilot by hand signal, requested the ground personnel to reconnect ground 
communication device. After connected, the ground personnel inform that the right wing of 
LNI026 aircraft collided with LNI770. The LNI026 pilot then informed the Soekarno-Hatta 
ground controller that the LNI026 aircraft collided with LNI 770. 
At 1159 UTC, the ground controller advised the LNI770 pilot to stop the taxi. The LNI770 
aircraft position was on taxiway SCX. 
Both aircraft returned to the parking stands and cancelled the flight. No one injured as result 
of this occurrences.
The investigation concerns to several safety issues related to the ground collision between the 
LNI770 and LNI026 aircraft that was on static condition. The aircraft movement analysis was 
based on communication between the air traffic controller, information from interview and the 
damage to the aircraft. The aircraft serviceability was considered not related to the event and 
will not be analyzed. 
The investigation concluded the contributing factor of the serious incident was:
The time pressure to arrive at the destination prior to the end of operating hour led to rush 
situation resulted in mis-judgment while making separation and the wings collided.
Following the investigation, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) issues safety 
recommendations addressed to the PT. Lion Mentari Airlines"

Republic of Indonesia","On 28 April 2016, a Cessna 172 G aircraft registered PK-TGL was being operated by Global 
Aviation Flying School on a solo flight training with intention to conduct six touch and go 
exercises in Budiarto Airport, Tangerang. On board the aircraft was one student pilot.
The aircraft departed runway 12 and performed three touch and go exercises uneventful.
On fourth touch and go exercise, while turning final at altitude of approximately 550 feet, the 
student pilot noticed that the aircraft speed was 70 knots. 
When the aircraft position was on short final at speed 70 knots with flaps 3, the aircraft 
position was slightly on the right of final approach path and the student pilot attempted to 
align the aircraft with the runway.
While the aircraft at above the runway threshold, the speed was approximately 60 knots, the 
aircraft yawed to the right and the pitch was slightly lower than the normal approach attitude 
thereafter, the student pilot put the throttle smoothly to idle. The aircraft then touched down 
on the right side of runway centerline with nose wheel touched first and the aircraft continued 
moving to the right then stopped outside the runway pavement.
The aircraft stopped out on the right of runway 12 with approximately 305 meters from the 
beginning runway 12 and 23 meters from runway centerline. Investigation found tire marks 
on the runway surface prior to the aircraft final position.
Recognizing the occurrence, the Budiarto Tower Controller activated the crash bell and 
informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) unit. The ARFF personnel 
immediately deployed to the occurrence site. 
Following the occurrence, the student pilot was taken to the nearest medical facility for 
medical examination and there was no injury or medical issue reported. No one injured on this 
occurrence and the aircraft was not damage.
There were no technical and/or aircraft system abnormality reported or recorded prior to the 
occurrence. Therefore, the analysis will not discuss the aircraft serviceability and will discuss 
the issue on landing technique.
The investigation concluded the contributing factor to this occurrence is focused to regain the 
directional control of the aircraft had delayed the flare out and lack of the rudder application 
resulted in the nose wheel touch down first and constant deviation travel away from the 
runway center line.
At the time of issuing this report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi had been 
informed any safety actions taken by the airport operator resulting from this occurrence.
Following this occurrence, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to Global

Republic of Indonesia","On 4 April 2016, Boeing 737-800 registration PK-LBS was being operated by Batik Air as 
scheduled passenger flight with flight number ID 7703 from Halim Perdanakusuma Airport
with intended destination Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. An ATR 42-
600 aircraft, registration PK-TNJ operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri was being 
repositioned from north to south apron of Halim Perdanakusuma Airport by a ground 
handling agent PT. Jasa Angkasa Semesta (PT. JAS). The aircraft was towed without aircraft 
electrical power fed to the system including the radio communication and aircraft lighting
system. 
At the time of occurrence, the ID 7703 pilot communicated to Halim Tower controller on 
frequency 118.6 MHz while the towing car driver communicated using handheld radio on 
frequency 152.73 KHz and was handled by assistant controller.
At 1948 LT (1248 UTC), ID 7703 pilot received taxi clearance from Halim Tower controller
and after the ID 7703 taxi, the towing car driver received clearance for towing and to report 
when on taxiway C. Afterward the towing car driver was instructed to expedite and to follow 
ID 7703.
While the ID 7703 backtracking runway 24, the towed aircraft entered the runway intended to 
cross and to enter taxiway G. At 1256 UTC, ID 7703 pilot received takeoff clearance and 
initiated the takeoff while the towed aircraft was still on the runway. The towing car driver 
and the pilots took action to avoid the collision. The decision of the pilot and the towing car 
driver to move away from the centerline runway had made the aircraft collision on the 
centerline runway (head to head) avoided, however the wings collision was unavoidable.
At 1257 UTC, the ID 7703 collided with the towed aircraft. The ID 7703 pilot rejected the 
takeoff and stopped approximately 400 meters from the collision point while the towed 
aircraft stopped on the right of the centerline runway 24.
No one injured at this occurrence and both aircraft severely damaged.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to the accident are:
 Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate 
frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the 
controllers, pilots and towing car driver.
 The communication misunderstanding of the instruction to follow ID 7703 most likely 
contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway.
 The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have 
diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that 
was installed with insufficient lightings.
Following this occurrence, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had been 
informed several safety actions taken by related parties. The KNKT acknowledges the safety
actions taken by the operators and aircraft manufacturer, there still remain safety issues that 
need to be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations addressed to PT.

flight attendants, and 125 passengers. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as pilot monitoring 
(PM) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as pilot flying (PF). 
The voice data did not record any checklist reading and approach briefing performed by the 
crew. Prior to the approach, both pilots discussed that they were going to make RNAV 
approach runway 07 and landing configuration with flap 5 and auto-brake low.
While flew over the initial approach point SEMAU, the aircraft was 2,000 feet above the 
required altitude as described on the instrument approach procedure. The approach path was 
shortened by deviated from published path and used higher speed. 
The aircraft was on higher than the approach profile and the pilots performed non-standard 
configuration setting by extended landing gear down first with intention to increase drag. The 
voice data recorded that after the landing gear extension the flap selected to position 1 and
continued to 2. 
The aural warning “HIGH SPEED” alternately with EGPWS warning “CAUTION

Airport, Jakarta (WIII) to Adisutjipto International Airport, Yogyakarta (WAHH) with flight 
number BTK 6380. The flight departed from Jakarta at 0713 UTC with total person on board 
of 168 people and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in 
Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight from departure until commencing 
approach into Yogyakarta was uneventful and there was no report or record of aircraft system 
abnormality during the flight.
After received meteorological information from Aerodrome Terminal Information Services 
(ATIS) the pilot decided to land with configuration flaps 40 and auto-brake 3. While 
approaching Yogyakarta, the pilots noticed cumulonimbus cloud over Yogyakarta then
decided to follow wind shear precaution recommendation to use flaps 30 for landing.
During Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach runway 09, the pilot received information 
that the runway was wet and decided to change the selection of the auto-brake from three to 
maximum.
The FDR data indicated that at altitude 10 feet the speed was 159 knots and floated for 6 
seconds then touched down at 730 meters from beginning runway 09 on speed 154 knots. The 
aircraft stopped at about 84 meters from end of runway 09 and passenger evacuation initiated 
9 minutes after. No one injured in this accident.
Four conditions affecting the landing distance, specifically the aircraft floated for about 6 
seconds and touched down at 427 meter beyond the aim point, after bouncing once; the 
airspeed at touchdown was 13 knots above Vref, and there was average tailwind of 6 knots; 
the thrust reversers were stowed at a higher than recommended speed and there was little 
braking for about 305 meter after the autobrakes were disconnected; and the wet runway 
conditions resulted in less deceleration.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are: 
 The absence of landing distance calculation following landing reconfiguration and the 
higher speed with no reminder callout might have made the pilots decided to continue 
landing, and
 The conditions of the aircraft floated and eventually touched down at the end of the 
touchdown zone 13 knots above Vref with average 6 knots tailwind, lower brake pressure 
for 305 meter after the autobrakes were disconnected, and removal of the thrust reverser 
application at a higher than recommended speed along with medium braking action had 
extended the landing distance.
The investigation also considered the external factors such as runway condition might have 
contributed to the reducing of deceleration rate while the brake pressure and thrust reversers 
were close to maximum.
Following this accident PT. Batik Air Indonesia has issued 24 safety actions which considered 
relevant to improve safety. In addition, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to

At 0445 UTC, the aircraft departed from Kupang and the flight until commenced for approach 
to Ende was uneventful. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as pilot flying (PF) while Second 
in Command (SIC) acted as pilot monitoring (PM). 
At 0537 UTC, the SIC advised to the Ende Aeronautic Communication Officer (ACO) that 
the aircraft was turning on final runway 27. The ACO responded that the wind direction was 
150° with velocity of 18 knots and advised that the runway was clear. According to pilot 
observation, the weather was clear without scattered cumulus. On short final, the SIC checked 
the wind shock located on the right side of beginning runway and was coherent to the 
information of the wind condition from the ACO.
The aircraft touched down on the touchdown zone with nose wheel touched the runway first 
and bounced to the left of runway centerline. The aircraft then experienced the second 
touchdown on the left shoulder of the runway. During the second bounce, the master warning 
light illuminated consisted with the “Pitch Disconnect” warning on the Engine and Warning
Display (EWD). The flight crew applied significant dual and opposite control columns inputs 
(leading to pitch uncoupling mechanism activation) - pitch down by the PIC on left seat and 
pitch up by the SIC on right seat (pitch up authority is higher).
After the second bounce, the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded an increasing value of 
TQs. The pilot performed a go around and turned right to avoid obstacle at the end of the 
runway 27. Both pilots assessed situation and decided to divert to Labuan Bajo. The flight 
continued uneventfully and landed safely at Labuan Bajo.
The investigation determined that the aircraft airworthiness serviceability was not an issue on 
this occurrence. Therefore, the analysis discusses the landing technique and pilot 
coordination. The investigation concluded the contributing factors of the occurrence as 
follows:
 Continuation of unstabilized approach with too much speed and nose down attitude 
resulted in the nose wheel touched the runway first, and with the roll about 3° to the left 
made the aircraft bounce to the left of runway centerline. 
 The absence of immediate go around initiation after the first bounce resulted in the aircraft 
made second touched down on the left shoulder of the runway.

Eurocopter (Airbus Helicopter) EC130 B4 helicopter, registration PK-BKA was being 
operated by PT. Penerbangan Angkasa Semesta (PT. PAS) on 11 October 2015 as 
unscheduled chartered flight. The flight was planned from Kualanamu International Airport
(Kualanamu) – Siparmahan and return. The helicopter departed Siparmahan at 1133 LT, on 
board in this flight were five persons consisted of one pilot, one engineer, and three 
passengers which were from the charterer agency.
During the flight the helicopter entered a condition and the visibility decreased significantly 
that might result in spatial disorientation to the pilot.
The helicopter impacted to the water, all occupants evacuated and floated used the seat 
cushions. On 13 October 2015 one survived passenger was rescued.
The investigation determines the contributing factors to this accident were:
 The pilot experienced of spatial disorientation during flying on low visibility resulted in 
the inability to determine aircraft attitude and position;
 Unavailability of individual flotation devices and un-inflated of aircraft flotation device
decreased the occupant survivability. 
The aircraft operator had performed several safety actions prior to the publishing of this

PT. Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from Tullamarine International Airport, 
Melbourne, Australia to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta, Indonesia with flight 
number GIA 717. There were two pilots, 11 flight attendants and 187 passengers on board.
During cruise and after the flight attendants served lunch, one of the flight attendants put 
pieces of dry ice inside an empty mineral water bottle and loaded it into the refrigerator unit in 
the middle galley.
Approximately 3 minutes after the dry ice was inserted into the refrigeration unit, the unit 
door burst. The refrigeration unit door was thrown towards and injured one of the Flight 
Attendant (FA). 
The other FA made an announcement and found doctor and a paramedic to administered first 
aid to the injured FA. The doctor advised the PIC that the injured FA’s condition was stable,
the bleeding had stopped and it was safe to continue the flight to Jakarta.
The aircraft landed safely at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta. The injured FA 
was transferred to the airport health facility and thereafter to the hospital in town. The injured 
flight attendant was the only person injured in this occurrence.
The investigation concluded that the burst of the refrigeration unit door was due to a result of 
pressure build-up that exceeded the capacity of the safety relief valve due to dry ice being 
placed in the refrigeration unit compartment. The door burst resulted in serious injuries to the 
flight attendant.
PT. Garuda Indonesia has put in several safety actions following this occurence. Komite 
Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) considered that the safety actions were relevant

The engineer on board was fatally injured, one passenger has minor injuries and the other 
occupants, including the pilot, were seriously injured. 
The investigation determined the contributing factors to this accident were:
 Continuing the flight with both airspeed indicators unserviceable increased the 
complexity of the flight combined with high-risk aerodrome increased the pilot 
workload.
 The improper corrective action at the time of the aural stall warning activating on the 
final approach, and the aircraft flew to insufficient area for a safe maneuver.
 The unfamiliarity to the airstrip resulted in inappropriate subsequent escape maneuver 
and resulted in the aircraft stalling.
 The pilot was not provided with appropriate training and familiarization to fly into a 
high-risk airstrip.

PT. Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta Airport, 
Jakarta to Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as 
Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). 
The calculation of the required runway length for the estimated aircraft landing weight 
with flaps 30 configuration was approximately 2,100 meters. 
After evaluation of weather condition, the controller changed the runway in use from 
runway 03 to runway 13. During approach on Instrument Landing System (ILS) runway 
13, the crew noticed that on the east of the airport was cloudy, the end of runway 13 was 
raining and approximately 1/4 part of the runway was wet on the end of runway 13. 
At approximately 100 ft Above Ground Level (AGL), the PM informed the PF that refer to 
the data displayed on the Navigation Display (ND), the tail wind was up to 10 kts and cross 
wind 10 kts from the right side of aircraft. 
During landing flare, the thrust levers were closed however the aircraft floated.The Cockpit 
Voice Recorder (CVR) data revealed that the interval between Enhanced Ground 
Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) call ‘ten’ to touchdown was 16 seconds while the 
Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded that after passing 20 ft to touchdown was 13 
seconds. Floating for 13 seconds with the current speed it was calculated that the aircraft 
has travelled approximately 1,075 meters. The FDR and airport Closed-circuit Television 
(CCTV) recorded that the aircraft touched down after passing taxiway Charlie. 
The flight crew did not consider a go around as they aware that the takeoff area of the 
runway 13 was mountainous area and might jeopardized the flight. 
The aircraft stopped at the left side of the stopway with the nose landing gear and left main 
landing gear stuck at the mud while the right main landing gear remain on the stopway

only person on board the aircraft.
Prior the flight, the student pilot was briefed by another student pilot who used the 
PK-LLA aircraft. The other student pilot advised experiencing hard landing however, 
the aircraft condition appeared remain normal. The other student pilot did not 
consider that the hard landing was occurrence that need to be reported. The student 
pilot then conducted preflight check of the aircraft condition and considered that the 
aircraft condition was normal included the nose landing gear.
About 1500 LT (0700 UTC3
), the aircraft departed runway 27 of Lombok with the 
fuel onboard sufficient for three hours flight time, the departure process until the 
third touch and go exercise was uneventful. During landing approach of the fourth 
touch and go, the student pilot used flaps 20° with speed about 75 knots. The aircraft 
touched down and continued rolling with the flaps still on 20°. When the speed was
about 40 knots, the student pilot felt the nose wheel impacted a patched-runway and 
bounced. The aircraft then touched down harder than usual, to recover the bounce, 
the student pilot increased the engine power and continued to go around. 
At 0740 UTC, the air traffic controller (controller) received information from 
aviation security officer that there was a detached nose wheel on the runway. After 
knowing that the detached nose wheel was from PK-LLA aircraft, the controller
informed the situation to the student pilot and instructed to make holding on left 
downwind runway 27. The controller also coordinated with other related units 
including Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) and LIFT representative.
At 0750 UTC, chief flight instructor of LIFT (flight instructor) came to tower and 
communicated with the student pilot to calm down the student pilot. The flight 
instructor instructed to perform a slow flight with flap 30° to minimized the aircraft 
speed and to perform low pass over runway 27 for landing gear observation. The 
student pilot performed low pass flying four times over runway 27.
Since the wind direction was from 090° until 120° with velocity of 8 to 10 knots, the 
flight instructor advised the controller to change the runway in use to runway 09 and 
was approved. The flight instructor then instructed the student pilot to exercise a low 
pass on runway 09. The student pilot performed low pass three times over runway 
09. The flight instructor briefed the student pilot of how to make landing approach in 
such condition and advised to switch off ignition, master switch, and fuel selector 
after landing."

this flight were eight occupants consisted of two pilots, one engineer, one flight operation 
officer (FOO) and four passengers. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) 
and Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 0136 UTC, the helicopter 
landed at Handil helipad and refueled up to approximately 1,600 lbs for the preparation to the 
pipe line inspection flight that was estimated would take 2 hours. The passenger doors on both 
sides of the cabin were removed to ease the inspection. 
At 0205 UTC, the helicopter departed from Handil helipad to CPU. On board this flight were 
seven occupants from Sepinggan consist of two pilots, one flight operation officer (FOO) and 
four passengers, while the engineer stayed at Handil.
After reached the cruising altitude of 1,000 feet the PIC handed over the control to the SIC. 
The SIC engaged the autopilot and flew maintain cruise altitude and speed of 95 knot. The 
weather was clear, wind condition was westerly at speed of 5 knots and visibility 
approximately 8 km. At position approximately 8 Nm from CPU the PIC asked the SIC to 
descend to 600 feet with the rate of 200 feet/minute. While passing 800 feet the helicopter 
attitude became un-commanded. The helicopter rolled to the left and pitch up then rolled to 
the right and pitch down. The SIC lowered the collective and reduced the helicopter speed 
with intention to recover the helicopter attitude with no success. The PIC took over the 
control to recover the helicopter until impacted the tree and crash into swamp. All the 
occupants were survived.
KNKT conducted several tests and research and concluded that the separation of rod end 
bearing from the push rod resulted to the helicopter enters un-commanded attitude.
The investigation determined the contributing factor was the helicopter un-commanded 
attitude caused by loosening of the jam nut on the forward rod end bearing which 
subsequently separated from the push rod, resulted in the un-commanded servo movement.
As result of these accidents FAA issued the Airworthiness Directive related to inspection of 
push rod.

The Mulia Airport was located at approximately 5,500 feet of elevation and 10% up slope 
runway which normally covered by clouds during the afternoon hours. 
According to the pilot interview, the approach crew briefing and the approach check list was 
performed prior to land on runway 08, no traffic on the ground and the runway was clear. The 
landing procedures were completed at about 6000 feet (approximate 500 feet Above Ground 
Level), and the aircraft aligned with the runway. 
The aircraft touched down within the touchdown point of runway 08, then bounced and 
floated. After second touchdown the aircraft started to veer to the left, the pilot recovered by 
the applying reverse thrust and brake, however the aircraft continued veered to the left. 
The aircraft stopped on the left side of the runway with left main and nose landing gear 
damaged and sunken into soft soil. 
The engine shutdown and the passengers disembark the aircraft normally. No persons injured 
in this occurrence. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident were; 
• The illusion of the runway condition resulted to the pilot misinterpret the situation and 
late to flare on touchdown and bounced. 
• The recovery action performed by the pilot resulted to the force that moved the aircraft 
further to the left and difficult to recover back to the runway centerline. 
At the time of issuing this draft final investigation report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan 
Transportasi (KNKT) has been informed of safety actions resulting from this occurrence. 
Includes in this final report, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations to address the 
safety issues identified in this final report to PT. Enggang Air Service to ensure that pilots 
performs correctly the standard call out and the implementation of COM Chapter 6 page 6-48, 
and to review the cornering landing technique and ensure that the pilots had well understand 
and sufficient skilled to this particular cornering technique. KNKT also recommended the 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to oversight the implementation of the 
recommendation addressed to PT. Enggang Air Service. "

Airport Surabaya (WARR) planned to perform runway maintenance that would be conducted at 
night after the runway operation. 
On 11 June 2014, between 0100 to 0500 LT, The Angkasa Pura I Brach Office Surabaya started
the runway maintenance that was performed by another company and consisted of 10 personnel
and used tools including pneumatic compressor, jack hammer, chisel, high air pressure hose, 
asphalt mixer, small container for asphalt mixture, debris sweeper and other supporting 
equipment. 
At 0405 LT, the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighter (ARFF) personnel performed the ARFF and
the Airport Facility Readiness personnel conducted runway readiness check in conjunction with 
patrolling the airside used patrol car. At 0430 LT, they reported to Juanda Tower controller that 
the runway was clear from any hazard except the area near intersection N3 where the runway 
repair was still in progress. At 0450 LT, the airport maintenance team reported to Juanda Tower 
controller that the runway repair had finished and the runway maintenance team had left the 
runway. No runway inspection was performed after the runway repair finished.
At 0500 LT, the airport operation initiated. Between 0500 LT and 0606 LT, 11 aircraft departure 
and one arrival, no pilot reported the foreign object on the runway. The first pilot report of 
objects was near the intersection taxiway N5 and was made at 0609 LT which was after sunrise 
at 0559 LT. This indicated that the objects were not clearly visible during dark time.
At 0615 LT, the controller contacted the Airport Facility Readiness personnel but no reply,
thereafter the controller contacted the ARFF personnel informed the pilot report of object on the 
runway and requested to check the existence of the reported object. When the ARFF vehicle 
arrived near the runway the controller instructed to wait for three aircraft that were about to 
land.
At 0620 LT, an ATR 72-212A (600 version) registered PK-WGK with flight number IW1861 
landed and impacted chisel, resulted in eight holes on the aircraft lower fuselage.
At 0623 LT, the controller decided to close the runway operation and instructed the ARFF 
personnel to enter and inspect the runway. The ARFF personnel found compressor hose (about 
10 meters long), jack hammer (about 60 cm long) and chisel (about 4.5 kg) on the runway.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident were:
 The runway inspection that was performed while the runway maintenance has not been 
finished resulted in the object which were on dark colour and found on dark surface did not 
properly inspect, and
 The insufficient information regarding the objects and the location might have made
improper assessment to the consequences of the runway operation and delaying the object 
removal.
Following the investigation, KNKT issues safety recommendations to PT. Angkasa Pura I

intended destination of Ninia Airstrip, Papua. On board in this flight were 7 persons consist 
of one pilot and six passengers. 
This flight was the fourth flights for the pilot. The flight time to Ninia was estimated of 1 
hour and was planned at cruising altitude of 10,000 feet and the fuel on board were 
sufficient for 4 hours flight time. 
At 0024 UTC, the pilot received clearance for takeoff. 
At 0027 UTC, Sentani Tower controller has not received reports from the PK-SDF pilot 
and tried to call but was not responded. 
At 0030 UTC, The Chief Section of Sentani Tower Air Navigation obtained information 
that the aircraft had experienced an accident during takeoff at Doyo Baru. 
The aircraft failed to lift off and impacted to several objects prior to stop at 30 meters from 
the end of the runway. The nose section damage after consumed by post impact fire. 
Two occupants including the pilot were fatally injured and five other occupants seriously 
injured. All occupants were taken to Yowari Hospital (Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah – 
RSUD Yowari). 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this occurrence was due to the 
aircraft was not in the correct takeoff configuration which required wing flap 20° while the 
flap was found on position of 6° during impact. The investigation concluded that the flap 
was selected during the takeoff roll when the pilot realized that the aircraft did not airborn 
on the position where normally became airborne. The pilot also operated the Emergency 
Power Lever intended to add more engine power. The corrective actions to recover the 
situation by selection of emergency power lever and flap were not proper for particular 
condition. 
At the time of issuing this Final Report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi 
has been informed safety action of the Adventist Aviation Indonesia by installing a CCTV

On board in this flight were two pilots, two flight attendants and 73 passengers. The Second 
in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot 
Non Flying (PNF). 
The pilot elected to fly via MKS VOR to avoid cumulonimbus cloud on the south east area 
from Makassar. The flight then vectored for Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach 
runway 03. 
At 1500 feet, the Hasanuddin Tower controller and was provided the landing clearance with 
additional information of wind which was from 120° up to 23 knots. Refer to the information 
from the controller and considered the experience of the SIC, the PIC took over the control of 
the aircraft and the SIC performed the duty as PNF.
The PIC noticed that on the right side of the final course was dark and thick cloud, while on 
the left was clear. 
At 08.00 UTC, the aircraft touched down normal on the touchdown zone. The pilot started to 
applied the brake and reverse the propeller. The FDR recorded that after touchdown, left 
rudder was applied gradually from 3° up to 27° and the aircraft heading was varied between 
026° to 031°. The application of left rudder reduced and changed to right rudder up to 26° and 
the aircraft heading changed from 030° to 074°. The aircraft then run off to the right of the 
runway. The aircraft skid and veered to the right and stopped at 15 meters from the runway 
pavement. 
No one injured in this serious incident. The aircraft suffer minor damage mainly on the 
landing gear doors. 
The investigation concluded that the incorrect rudder application to compensate the crosswind 
affect had resulted in the aircraft exiting the runway. This might due to the pilot confusion to 
the crosswind effect as result of inadequate training.

After performing some exercises, the aircraft returned to Tunggul Wulung airport and the 
non-flying pilot requested to Tunggul Wulung controller to join the right downwind of 
runway 13 at 1,000 ft and intended to join right base. At short final, the pilot performed the 
approach with slightly above the glide due to an obstacle surround the area. According to the
pilot report, the pilot flew the aircraft at approach speed of 70 Kts when over the threshold, 
leveling the wings and close throttle. After the main wheels touched the runway and while the 
pilot expecting the nose wheel touching the runway, the propeller hit the ground and the nose 
landing gear collapsed.
The aircraft stop at 181 meters from the point of the main wheel touched the runway and 
approximate 35 meters before the aircraft stop there were several marks of propeller and the 
nose landing gear contacted the runway.
The analysis discussed the landing technique and the broken of the nose landing gear and 
concluded that:
- The aircraft landed in the normal landing technic and procedure.
- There was fatigue crack propagated from internal, but the crack could not be detected 
visually.
- This initial fatigue crack might be suspected from manufacturing pipe failure, and the 
failure will rarely occur.

On 27 January 2014, a Boeing 737-300 registration PK-CKL was being operated by PT. 
Sriwijaya Air on schedule passenger flight from Sepinggan Airport, Balikpapan (BPN / 
WALL) to Juanda International Airport, Surabaya (SUB / WARR). The aircraft departed from 
Balikpapan at 0109 UTC. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) and 
the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF). 
Prior to the flight both pilots did not receive information of the current NOTAM (Notice to 
Airmen) for Juanda International Airport either from Balikpapan or Jakarta flight operation 
office. On the day of this serious incident, there was a NOTAM regarding to the status of 
taxiway SP2 that was closed due to work in progress of scrubbing, overlay and paving 
shoulder and was valid from 1 to 30 January 2014. 
The pilot conducted the VOR/DME approach for runway 28. During the interview the PM 
stated that the weather was hazy and at 600 feet, both pilots saw the darker and shinier object 
on the surrounding area which they assumed as the runway. The pilots flew toward the object 
and raised some question to the controller regarding to the several objects on the runway. 
The aircraft flew at low altitude below 50 feet over the taxiway SP2 up to touch down for 
approximately 29 seconds. 
There was hazard report from a pilot reported the possibility of mistaking taxiway for runway 
during conducting a VOR/DME approach runway 28, which was received 30 days before this 
occurrence. 
No one injured and no damage to the aircraft in this serious incident. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident were as 
follow; 
• The environment of the airport and the condition of the taxiway approach created an 
illusion that the SP2 taxiway appeared brighter than the active runway for pilot on the 
final approach. 
• The absence of the operator SOP related to the requirement for go around on uncertain 
condition and the NOTAM information which might became the short term memory 
have made the pilot elected to continue landing following uncertain condition prior to 
land. 
Prior to issue this final investigation report, the KNKT had been informed of safety actions 
resulting of the internal investigation by the operators concerning to operational safety related 
to this occurrence. 
Included in this final report, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations to PT.

PT. Intan Angkasa Air Service, on positioning flight from Sentani Airport, Jayapura with 
intended destination of Juanda Airport, Surabaya for aircraft maintenance. The positioning 
flight was planned to transit at Dumatubun Airport Langgur of Tual, Maluku and Haluoleo 
Airport, Kendari at South East Sulawesi for refuelling.
On the first sector, the aircraft departed Sentani Airport at 2351 UTC (0851 WIT) and 
estimated arrival at Langgur was 0320 UTC. On board on this flight was one pilot, two 
company engineers and one ground staff.
At 0240 UTC the pilot contacted to the Langgur FISO, reported that the aircraft position was 
85 Nm to Langgur Airport at altitude 10,000 feet and requested weather information. Langgur
FISO acknowledged and informed that the weather was rain and thunderstorm and the runway 
in used was 09.
When the aircraft passing 5,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Langgur FISO and reported that 
the aircraft position was 50 Nm from langgur and informed the estimated time of arrival was 
0320 UTC. The Langgur FISO acknowledged and advised the pilot to contact when the 
aircraft was at long final runway 09.
At 0318 UTC, the pilot contacted Langgur FISO, reported the position was 25 Nm to Langgur
at altitude of 2,500 feet and requested to use runway 27. The Langgur FISO advised the pilot 
to contact on final runway 27.
At 0325 UTC, Langgur FISO contacted the pilot with no reply.
At 0340 UTC, Langgur FISO received information from local people that the aircraft had 
crashed.
The aircraft was found at approximately 1.6 Nm north east of Langgur Airport at coordinate 
5° 38’ 30.40” S; 132° 45’ 21.57” E. All occupants fatally injured and the aircraft destroyed by 
impact force and post impact fire.
The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post impact fire, several parts of the 
remaining wreckage such as cockpit could not be examined due to the level of damage. The 
aircraft was not equipped with flight recorders and the communication between ATC and the 
pilot was not recorded. No eye witness saw the aircraft prior to impact. Information available 
for the investigation was limited. The analysis utilizes available information mainly on the 
wreckage information including the information of the wings, engines and propellers.
Based on the available evidences, the investigation concluded that the left engine failed 
during approach. The propeller did not set to feather resulted in significant asymmetric forces 
on the left and right side of the aircraft. The asymmetric forces created yaw and roll tendency 
and the aircraft became uncontrolled, subsequently led the aircraft to impact to the terrain.
Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had not been informed any safety action 
taken by related parties. KNKT issue safety recommendations to address safety issues 
identified on this investigation to aircraft operator and Directorate General of Civil Aviation

Indonesia was on scheduled passenger flight from Ngurah Rai International Airport (WADD), 
Bali, to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (WIII), Tangerang, Indonesia. On board in this 
flight were two pilots, 11 flight attendants, 185 passengers. 
There was no reported or recorded that the aircraft had system abnormality during the flight 
from take-off until the time of the occurrence. 
The weather report for Soekarno-Hatta International Airport was broadcasted at 08.00 UTC 
and 08.45 UTC was moderate rain, thunder storm, wind direction was north-westerly and no 
significant weather were reported. 
At 124 ft, the autopilot was disengaged and the pilot resumed hand flying. Prior to touchdown 
after Flight Warning Computer (FWC) callout “TWENTY”, the SIC called “fly left” for two 
times, and followed by the FWC callout “RETARD” for tree times within three seconds. 
During the interview, the pilots explained that at about flare out altitude the aircraft entered a 
heavy rain impacted the left windshield and the PF loss of visual reference. The PF also felt 
that the aircraft floating. The PNF explained that he was able to see the runway all the time 
and observed that the aircraft was slightly on the right of the runway and advised the PF to fly 
left two times. 
At 08.00 UTC the aircraft touched down with the right main landing gear were on the right 
shoulder and travelled for 500 meters and returned to the runway then proceeded to taxiway 
S5. 
The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft system, therefore the 
analysis part of this final report focused on four safety issues, such as: course deviation prior 
to touchdown, approach and landing techniques, decision to land and meteorological 
concerning to the observing and reporting of visibility. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this serious incident were as the 
following factors: 
During the hand flying at approximately 90 feet AGL the aircraft started rolled in average 
of 2° to the right for approximately 12 seconds resulted to aircraft deviation to the right, 
whilst the PF loss the visual reference and prolong flare prior to touch down. 
• The above condition was an indication for go around which was not executed, this 
might cause by insufficient pilot intuitive decision to cope such condition. 
• The absence of no significant weather report might influence the pilot judgment and 
expectation of any weather change which may requires pilot decisions especially 
when occurs at low altitude. 
Following this serious incident, the VP Flight Operation of PT. Garuda Indonesia issued 
safety actions as shown in the appendix 6 of this final report. 
As result from the investigation Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi issued several 
safety recommendations addressed to PT. Garuda Indonesia, Badan Meteorologi Klimatologi

At 00:36 the AWQ pilot requested taxi clearance and was cleared to taxi to holding point 
runway 27 via November Two (N2) by Adi Tower controller. The pilot reconfirm that the 
taxi way was N2 and requested to taxi via November Three (N3) taxiway. The Adi Tower 
controller reconfirm that the taxi way was N2 and continued by providing ATC clearance. 
The pilot tought that they were cleared to taxi to holding point runway 27 which was 
located on the taxiway N3, close to the runway 27 threshold. There was no other traffic 
communicated with Adi Tower controller. 
Prior the aircraft entered the runway the PIC shouted that there was an aircraft on final. 
Almost at the same time Adi Tower controller instructed to AWQ 8441 pilot to hold at 
present position. The PIC instinctively selected the throttles to reverse and applied brake to 
stop the aircraft and if possible moved backward. The aircraft stopped with the nose 
section 16 meters passed the yellow marking line of N2 taxiway on approximate heading 
170.

The Yogya Approach controller advised to the pilot that runway was clear and gave 
clearance to land if the runway insight. 
The BTK pilot reported that the runway insight when the aircraft was on 3.5 miles to touch 
down. The Yogya Approach controller advised the pilot to contact Adi Tower controller 
after landing. 
After saw that the AWQ aircraft has entered the runway, while the BTK aircraft was 
approximately at 600 feet, the Adi Tower controller advised to the Yogya Approach 
controller to instruct BTK pilot to go around. The instruction was not passed to BTK pilot 
with consideration that the BTK aircraft was on short final and a go around might 
jeopardized the safety of the flight. 
The Adi Tower controller instructed BTK pilot to go around, however this instruction was 
not acknowledge by BTK pilots. 
Just after touched down, the BTK pilot saw that of the AWQ aircraft was on taxiway N2 
and the nose section had entered the runway. The BTK pilot then applied the maximum 
manual braking and full thrust reverse and the aircraft stopped at approximately 100 meters 
to the AWQ aircraft position. 
Refer to the calculation the required landing distance for medium braking action was 6,614 
feet or 2,016 meters and for good braking action was 4,813 feet or 1,467 meters. The 
vi 
landing distance of the BTK aircraft was approximately 1650 meters. The pilot action had 
avoided a collision between aircrafts. 
The investigation determined contributing factors involve in this occurrence were: 
• Misinterpretation between pilots and controller related to the position of holding point 
runway 27 and the taxi clearance had never been clearly clarified. 
• There was no transfer of control from Yogya Approach controller to Adi Tower 
controller and the landing clearance for the BTK flight was issued by Yogya Approach 
controller resulting to the initiative instruction from Adi Tower controller to BTK pilot 
to go around was not acknowledged by BTK pilots.

The aircraft departed from Sentani at 2206 UTC to Nalca Airstrip which is about south of 
Sentani Airport for duration of 50 minutes flight time and cruised at flight altitude of 
10,000 feet. in this flight, the pilot was conducting a Visual Flight Rule (VFR). As from 
the interview with the pilot, he stated that this flight was the first flight experience from 
Sentani to Nalca airstrip. 
There were 10 person on board which was consisting of one pilot and nine passengers. 
The weather en route to and over the Nalca airstrip was fine and the wind was calm. There 
were no any abnormalities and or recorded during the flight.The pilot flew the aircraft to 
overhead the airstrip for observing the runway then to join the downwind of runway 24. 
At 22:56 the aircraft touched down runway 24 at landing speed about 78 knots and slightly 
on the right of the center line. At approximately 20 meters before the parking area which 
was on the right side of the runway, the right main wheel trapped and stopped with right 
wing slightly down and right wheel concealed in the ground in about one meter. 
After the aircraft stopped the pilot shutdown the engine in normal procedure, and helped 
the passengers to disembark the aircraft from left side of aircraft. No persons injured. 
The aircraft evacuated from the runway and placed at west and safe area out of the air strip. 
The investigation concluded that the absence of airstrip information had made the pilot not 
aware of the runway surface condition that might due to improper of risk management in 
seeking the risk to identify, analyze, assess and control the risks. "

introduced. Since June 2013, the flying school changed the fuel type from AVGAS to 
MOGAS and the lean takeoff procedure was still applied. 
The maintenance record showed that the aircraft was grounded on 7 and 11 Sep’13 due to 
loss of power during the engine power check. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of the accident were as follow: 
1. The engine were overheating for some period of time (few days) as result of the 
combination of lean mixture in high engine power and the use of lower octane fuel 
which in the area of heavy detonation zone. 
2. The process of the change of AVGAS to MOGAS which was classified as alteration 
was not accordance with the CASR sub part 43.13. 
3. The discrepancies appeared after the use of MOGAS was unresolved within the 
management. 
Prior to issuing this final report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Tarsnportasi (KNKT) has 
been informed several safety actions taken by PT. Aviasi Solusi Prima (FlyBest Flight 
Academy) concerning to the leaning mixture procedure, inspections to the engines, fuel

instructed to contact Minangkabau Tower controller. The pilot intended to make a visual 
approach and disconnected the autopilot then flew manually toward that runway. When 
conducting the visual approach, the pilot assumed that the localizer was incorrect as the 
runway was on the right side. The pilot continued the approach with landing gear down and 
flap 40. The PIC also realized that the rate of descent was about 1,700 feet per minute.
After landing, the pilot reported to Minang tower that they had landed at Tabing Airfield. The 
passengers were completely disembarked safely.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are the unclear 
significant information in the photocopy of the ILS approach chart might have missed by the 
pilot and might reduce the pilot awareness to the adjacent airport with similar runway 
direction and dimension; the previous experience of false VOR might have made the approach 
was continued in an un-stabilized approach condition, and the information of incorrect 
runway was not provided during the abnormal approach as it was not observed.
Following this accident the aircraft operator has issued six safety actions and the airport 
operator has issued two safety actions which considered relevant to improve safety. In 
addition, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to aircraft operator, air navigation 
provider and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation."

The evacuation performed as procedures, crew and passenger were no injured. 
The passenger picked up by airport bus to arrival hall. 
Engineer checked the aircraft and found the Hydraulic Hose of RH MLG up-lock actuator at 
the “Lock Port” position was leak. 
The factors contributed to this serious incident were as follows: 
1. Defective hydraulic hose of RH MLG Actuator at “Lock Port” position was made the 
hydraulic fluid drawn overboard. 
2. The defective hydraulic hose is likely consistent with fatigue mode initiated by fretting 
damage on the wire mesh as a result of vibration. 
3. It likely that loss of hydraulic system A followed by los of system B was due to the 
defective of EHSV P/N 73016 that led the Main Rudder PCU had excessive internal 
leak.

flight instructor and one student. 
At 1233 LT (0533 UTC), the aircraft departed from Cirebon then flew via Suranengala to 
Karang Ampel area.
At 0545 UTC, the aircraft reached Karang Ampel area and conducted training exercises of 
climbing turn, steep turn, stall recovery, slow flight descend and engine failure exercise. 
During the engine failure exercise, the student pilot performed clearing engine procedure 
several times. At altitude 700 feet, the student pilot made a go around and climbed to intended 
altitude of 1,500 feet for returning to Cirebon. During climbing, the pilots saw that the engine 
power indicated 1,800 rpm, and the pilot felt that the engine was hesitating. The flight 
instructor then took over the aircraft control performed forced landing to coastline area at 
approximately 3 Nm north of checkpoint Suranenggala. 
The aircraft touched down on the muddy surface and flipped. The flight instructor and the 
student evacuated the aircraft and no one injured in this occurrence.
Investigation conducted examination to the engine to determine the cause of the engine 
failure. The engine examination did not find any abnormality. The examination of induction 
system found a piece of rubber at the inside of the throttle chamber of the carburetor with
dimension of 12 cm length and 0.8 cm width that believed originated from the flapper valve 
of the induction box. 
The detachment of the rubber presumably due to repeated bending action against the box wall 
at “CLOSE” position caused fatigue to the rubber.
The presence of the rubber in the throttle chamber interrupted the supply of fuel air mixture to 
the piston chamber and resulted in the improper combustion. The improper combustion was 
identified by the pilot as the engine hesitation.
Prior to this publishing of this report, the operator has stopped the training operation.
Following this accident, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had been 
informed safety actions taken by the Wings Flying School and the KNKT acknowledges the 
safety actions. However, there still remain safety issues that need to be considered and

Inconsistency to the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) for the rectifications 
performed during the period of the reversers and auto speed brake deployment 
problem was might probably result of the unsolved symptom problems. 
The decision to land during the un-stabilized approach which occurred from 1000 feet 
to 50 feet above threshold influenced by lack of crew ability in assessing to accurately 
perceive what was going on in the flight deck and outside the airplane. 
The effect of delayed of the speed brake and thrust reverser deployment effected to the 
aircraft deceleration which required landing distance greater than the available landing 
distance.

Airport, Makassar with destination El Tari Airport, Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara. The 
flight number was Merpati 5840 and carried 94 person on board consist of 88 passengers 
including four children and four infants, two pilot and four flight attendant. A 
maintenance engineer was on-board in this flight. Acting as pilot flying was the Second 
in Command (SIC) while the Pilot in Command acted as Pilot Monitoring. 
On approach, the pilot selected landing gear to down position. The left main landing gear 
indicator light was showed red, its means that the left main landing gear was not in down 
position and unsafe for landing. 
The pilot reported to the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) for a go-around and requested an 
area for holding to solve the problem. The ATC gave a clearance to hold over Kupang 
bay. 
The pilot tried to solve the problem by conducting the procedure according to the 
emergency checklist, including selected the landing gear by alternate selector. 
The pilot then requested to the ATC to fly at low altitude over the airport and asked to 
the ATC to observe the landing gear condition. The pilot also asked through the company 
radio for an engineer on-ground to observe visually the landing gear condition. 
The pilot then returned to the holding area, repeated the procedure but unsuccessful. 
Both pilots and engineer had a discussion and decided to attempt un-procedural method 
to make the landing gear down. Prior making these efforts the pilot announced to the 
passengers about the problem and their attempts that might be unpleasant to the 
passengers. 
After all attempts to lower the landing gear had failed, the pilot decided to land with the 
left main landing gear in up position. The pilot also asked the flight attendant to prepare 
for an abnormal landing. 
The ATC were prepared the airport fire fighting and ambulance, and also contacted the 
local police, armed forces, and hospitals and asking for additional ambulances. The ATC 
then informed the pilot that the ground support was ready. 
On short final the pilot instructed ‘brace for impact’ and the FA repeated that instruction 
to all passengers. 
The aircraft touched down at the touch down zone on runway 07. The pilot flying held 
the left wing as long as possible and kept the aircraft on the centre line, and the pilot 
monitoring shut down both engines."

Republic of Indonesia","On 30 October 2009, a Boeing Company 737-300 aircraft, operated by Garuda 
Indonesia as flight GA142, registered PK-GGQ, was being flown on a scheduled 
passenger service from Soekarno–Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Sultan Iskandar Muda 
Airport, Banda Aceh, via Polonia Airport, Medan. There were 55 persons on board; 
two pilots, four flight attendants, and 49 passengers. 
The aircraft took off from Jakarta runway 07L at 0129 UTC. During the takeoff the 
number-two wheel separated from its axle and fell from the aircraft onto the runway. 
The air traffic controller subsequently informed the crew that one of the aircraft’s 
main wheels had fallen from the aircraft onto the runway during the takeoff. The pilot 
in command (PIC) decided to return to Jakarta. The controller informed the airport 
rescue and fire fighting service (RFFS), and RFFS personnel and vehicles stood by 
during the landing. 
The PIC taxied the aircraft off the runway and stopped it on taxiway NP1. The 
passengers disembarked normally via airstairs about 15 minutes after the landing. The 
RFFS crews were standing by the aircraft in case of a fire. None of the aircraft’s 
occupants were injured. 
The investigation determined that it was likely that the detachment of the number-two 
main wheel from its axle was due to the catastrophic failure of the wheel bearings. 
The bearing failures would then have resulted from an under-torque condition during 
the re-installation of the number-two main wheel, following the replacement of the 
brake unit. 
The recent main wheel installation was conducted on the airport apron during the 
hours of darkness, and flash lights were used to illuminate the work. The work 
environment was not conducive to ensuring that the work could be performed safely 
and in accordance with approved procedures. 
On 6 November 2009, PT. Garuda Indonesia informed the National Transportation 
Safety Committee that PT. GMF AeroAsia had commenced a number of safety 
actions to address safety concerns arising from this serious incident, including: a 
Quality Assurance Reminder drawing engineers’ attention to specific maintenance 
quality and safety requirements; a scheduled retraining program for engineers 
involved in wheel and brake replacement to be completed by 19 February 2010; and 
on 6 and 10 November issued Engineer Orders for Main Gear Wheel Axle Nut 
Torque Check and Bearing Inspection to be completed by 30 November 2009. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee issued recommendations to PT. GMF 
AeroAsia, PT. Garuda Indonesia, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, with 
respect to reviewing maintenance guidance documentation, training and supervision 
to ensure that correct practices are followed, and an appropriate maintenance 
environment is available. 
On 23 December 2009, PT. GMF AeroAsia submitted a Customer Originated Change 
to the Boeing Company requesting an amendment to the wheel nut torquing 
procedures for Boeing 737 aircraft. PT. GMF AeroAsia also issued an Engineering 
Information document to its engineers detailing interim procedures pending the 
issuance of the Boeing amendment to the Boeing 737-345 Aircraft Maintenance 
Manual, which Boeing has indicated will be promulgated in September 2010. "

 Republic of Indonesia","On the morning of Sunday, 2 August 2009, a de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter 
aircraft, registered PK-NVC, operated by PT. Merpati Nusantara Airlines as flight 
number MZ-7960D, departed from Sentani Airport, Jayapura for Oksibil Airport. 
The flight was planned in accordance with the visual flight rules (VFR). There 
were 15 persons on board; two pilots, one engineer, 10 adult passengers and two 
infants. 
The estimated flight time was 50 minutes. The fuel on board was sufficient for 2 
hours and 50 minutes flight time. 
About 15 minutes prior to the estimated time of arrival at Oksibil the crew of 
another aircraft informed the Twin Otter crew that the weather in the Oksibil area 
was partly cloudy. There were no further reports of radio transmissions from the 
Twin Otter, and it did not arrive at Oksibil. 
A search was initiated at the time the aircraft would have run out of fuel. On the 
morning of 4 August 2009, searchers located the wreckage of the Twin Otter at an 
elevation of about 9,300 feet about 6 Nm from Oksibil. The aircraft was destroyed 
by impact forces, and all of the occupants were fatally injured. 
The pilots did not maintain visual flight procedures when flying below lowest safe 
altitude, and the aircraft was flown into cloud in the vicinity of gap north west of 
Oksibil. 
The accident was consistent with controlled flight into terrain. It was not 
survivable. 
As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety Committee 
issued recommendations to address safety issues identified in this report, 
specifically with respect to: maintenance procedures and maintenance inspection 
programs, to ensure that Emergency Locator Transmitters are serviceable; and the 
provision of weather information services for all civilian aircraft operations 
throughout Papua. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee also reissued recommendations to 
address safety issues identified in this report. (Previously issued on 23 December

operated by PT. Travel Express Aviation Services (Expressair), flight number XN-9001,
on a scheduled passenger flight from Jayapura to Tanah Merah. The flight departed from
Jayapura at 2230 UTC (07:30 local time) with an estimated arrival time at Tanah Merah of
0017. There were 36 people on board; two pilots, one cabin crew, and 33 passengers.
The pilot in command (PIC) was pilot flying and the copilot was the support/monitoring
pilot.
The crew flew the aircraft overhead Tanah Merah and joined left downwind at 900 feet.
Final approach was reported to have been normal with VREF 105 knots.
The aircraft touched down at 0017, towards the departure at end of the runway 25
touchdown zones at Tanah Merah Airport, Boven Digoel, Papua. The crew reported that
the touched down was normal.
During the landing roll the PIC used reverse thrust to slow the aircraft. After a landing roll
of approximately 500 meters, reverse thrust was reduced and the condition levers were
selected to minimum. The crew reported that without warning, the aircraft diverged
abruptly to the right and they were not able to arrest the swing using full left rudder and
left brake. The aircraft left the runway and stopped on the shoulder approximately 10
meters away from the edge of runway, and approximately 600 meters from touchdown
area.
The right wheels sank into the soft ground of the runway shoulder, and the left wheels and
the nose wheels were on the shoulder. The right propeller blades fractured as they struck
the ground and the propeller assembly was torn from the engine and came to rest
approximately 4.5 meters from the right engine. The right engine was substantially
damaged.
The investigation is continuing and will include a detailed review of flight recorder data,
and operational procedures to determine if they may have contributed to this accident. The

registered PK-ANW, operated by Sekolah Tinggi Penerbangan Indonesia (STPI), 
on a local training flight from Budiarto Airport (Curug), Tangerang, Banten, 
Indonesia, impacted terrain about 13 km southwest of the aerodrome. 
Thunderstorms, strong wind, and heavy rain were in the area at the time. 
There were three persons on board the aircraft; one flight instructor and two 
student pilots. The instructor was fatally injured, and the two student pilots were 
seriously injured. 
The aircraft was airworthy during when it departed from Curug. It was destroyed 
by the impact forces, and the damage to the aircraft was consistent with it being in 
an aerodynamically stalled condition at the time of impact. 
During the investigation it was concluded that there was a lack of supervision and 
instruction from STPI regarding the aircraft’s continued operation in adverse 
weather condition. Those requirements were documented in the STPI operating 
handbooks. 
It was also concluded that the injuries sustained by two of the occupants during the 
impact were the result of them not having properly worn their safety harnesses. 
Other safety issues were identified during the investigation. They included ground based very high frequency radio communication equipment and ground-based wind 
direction indication equipment. Those issues did not contribute to the accident, but 
were identified as safety deficiencies. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee’s report includes recommendations 
to STPI, Budiarto Airport Operator, and Directorate General of Civil Aviation to 
address safety deficiencies, both with the aircraft operation and the aerodrome 
equipment. "
105, ,KNKT.09.04.13.04,Pilatus Porter PC-6,17-Apr-09,"Mt. Gergaji, Papua
Republic of Indonesia","On the morning of 17 April 2009, a Pilatus PC-6/B2-H4 Turbo Porter aircraft, 
registered PK-LTJ, operated by PT. Mimika Air, charter flight from Ilaga to Mulia 
in the Puncak Jaya District of Papua. The Mimika Local Government owned the 
aircraft. There were 11 people on board; one pilot, one observer, and nine 
passengers comprised of eight adults and one infant. The aircraft was also carrying 
National Government election boxes. 
The flight in accordance with the visual flight rules was estimated to take 18 
minutes. There was no record of communication with the aircraft during the flight. 
Two minutes after the estimated time of arrival, when the Porter had not arrived, a 
search was commenced. On 18 April, search aircraft located the wreckage of the 
Porter at an elevation of about 12,000 feet on Mt Gergaji. The location was on the 
direct track between Ilaga and Mulia. The aircraft impacted the ground in an 
inverted attitude, and was destroyed by the impact forces and the post-impact fire. 
All occupants were fatally injured. 
The weather in the valleys along the route was mostly clear, with cloud on the 
mountains. The route flown by the pilot was the direct track, which passed over a 
mountain range, with a high peak adjacent to, and west of the track at about the 
midway point, at 13,700 feet. 
The investigation determined that it was likely that the pilot had flown the aircraft 
into cloud and lost control of the aircraft in instrument meteorological conditions. 
The impact signature was consistent with uncontrolled flight at the time of impact. 
This probably resulted from the pilot becoming spatially disoriented after entering 
cloud. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee made recommendations to the 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation relating to pilot licensing and route 
familiarization for pilots operating in remote and mountainous regions such as 
Papua. Particular attention should be given to visual flight operations in 
mountainous and unpredictable weather conditions"

Republic of Indonesia","On the morning of 9 April 2009, a British Aerospace BAe 146-300 aircraft, 
registered PK-BRD, was being operated by PT. Aviastar Mandiri Airlines as a 
scheduled passenger and cargo flight from Sentani Airport to Wamena 
Airport, Papua. The crew consisted of two pilots, two flight attendants, an 
engineer, and a load master. 
The aircraft performed a go-around from the initial landing approach on 
runway 15 at Wamena. The flight crew positioned the aircraft on a right 
downwind leg for another landing approach. As the aircraft was turned 
towards the final approach for the second landing approach at Wamena it 
impacted terrain and was destroyed. All of the occupants were fatally injured. 
The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) manufacturer 
performed simulations using data from the flight recorders, and two separate 
terrain data sources. The manufacturer informed the investigation that “the 
GPWS/EGPWS alerts recorded in the CVR were issued as designed”. 
However the enhanced Look-Ahead function appeared to have been inhibited 
following the go around. There was no evidence from the CVR that the crew 
had deliberately inhibited the terrain function of the EGPWS. The 
investigation determined that the EGPWS issued appropriate warnings to the 
flight crew, in the GPWS mode. 
The pilot in command did not take appropriate remedial action in response to 
repeated EGPWS warnings. The investigation concluded that flight crew’s 
lack of awareness of the aircraft’s proximity with terrain, together with non 
conformance to the operator’s published operating procedures, resulted in the 
aircraft’s impact with terrain. 
As a consequence of this accident, the operator took safety action to address 
deficiencies in its documentation for missed approach procedures at Wamena. 
As a result of this accident, the National Transportation Safety Committee 
(NTSC) also issued safety recommendations to the operator and to the 
Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) to ensure that relevant 
documented safety procedures are implemented. 
During the investigation, safety issues were identified concerning modification 
of aircraft and DGCA approval of those modifications. While those safety 
issues did not contribute to the accident, they nevertheless are safety 
deficiencies. Accordingly, the NTSC report includes recommendations to 
address those identified safety issues."

from Sultan Hasanuddin Airport (WAAA), Makassar, Ujung Pandang, Sulawesi at 
0636 UTC for Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (WIII), Jakarta. The estimated 
flight hour from Makassar to Jakarta was 2 hours. The crew consisted of two pilots 
and four flight attendants. There were 166 adult passengers. 
The copilot was the pilot flying for the sector, and the pilot in command (PIC) was the 
support/monitoring pilot. 
During the approach to runway 25L at Jakarta, the weather at the airport was reported 
as wind direction 200 degrees, wind speed 20 knots, visibility 1,000 meters, and rain. 
The PIC reported that he decided to take over control from the copilot. 
The PIC later reported that he had the runway in sight passing through 1,000 feet on 
descent, and he disengaged the autopilot at 400 feet. At about 50 feet the aircraft 
drifted to the right and the PIC initiated corrective action to regain the centreline. The 
aircraft touched down to the left of the runway 25L centerline and then commenced to 
drift to the right. The PIC reported that he immediately commenced corrective action 
by using thrust reverser, but the aircraft increasingly crabbed along the runway with 
the tail to the right of runway heading. The investigation subsequently found that the 
right thrust reverser was deployed, but left thrust reverser was not deployed. 
The aircraft stopped at 0835 on the right side of the runway 25L, 1,095 meters from 
the departure end of the runway on a heading of 152 degrees; 90 degrees to the 
runway 25L track. The main landing gear wheels collapsed, and still attached to the

crew consisted of two pilots and four flight attendants. There were 156 passengers; 148 
adults, four children, and four infants. 
After takeoff, during the landing gear up procedure, the pilot noted one red light illuminate 
(nose gear) on the landing gear panel. During the investigation the pilots reported that they 
recycled the landing gear and the subsequent cockpit indication was that the landing gear was 
in the up and locked position. The pilots continued the flight to the planned destination Hang 
Nadim Aiport, Batam. 
During final approach at Batam, the pilots noted that the red light nose gear indicator was 
illuminated. The pilot in command (PIC) decided to conduct a go around and hold to perform 
the emergency checklist to attempt to extend the nose landing gear. After many attempts to 
extend the landing gear, the nose landing gear red indicator light remain illuminated. The PIC 
decided to make an emergency landing on runway 04 without the nose landing gear extended. 
The aircraft subsequently stopped on the runway 04 on the centre line. 
Emergency personnel and vehicles from Hang Nadim Airport prepared for the emergency, 
and laid foam on the runway before the aircraft landed, to eliminate fire hazard. 
The passengers and crew evacuated via the left front door escape slide. None of the occupants 
were injured. 
The initial investigation found that the nose landing gear spray (water) deflector had 
fractured, jamming the nose landing gear in the up position. 
The investigation is continuing and will include the operational procedures used during the 
flight to address the landing gear malfunction, and analysis of the mode of failure of the nose 
landing gear spray deflector.

Sultan Hasanuddin Airport Makassar as flight MZ 762, with an intended destination 
of Frans Kaisiepo Airport, Biak. There were two pilots, five flight attendants, and 164 
passengers on board including 14 infants. 
The co-pilot was intended to be the handling pilot on this sector, while the Pilot in 
Command (PIC) was the support/monitoring pilot. 
The flight was the second flight sector of the day for the pilots and the aircraft, after 
the first departure from Soekarno–Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Makassar. There was no 
abnormality reported on the first sector. The actual aircraft turn around time at 
Makassar was about 55 minutes prior the next departure. 
The crew taxied out off apron and proceed to runway 31 for departure. There was 
another aircraft taxied out before them. The crew elected to taxi slowly to prevent 
hold on short of runway to give sufficient distance to the traffic ahead. The crew 
successfully managed the taxi speed and entered the runway for departure without 
stopping the aircraft. 
The aircraft had a total takeoff weight of 60,400 kg and was configured for a takeoff 
with flap 5. The V1 for this weight and configuration was 145 knots. 
Weather at the airport was raining and the runway was wet. The crew used full thrust 
take off power. 
The aircraft started to roll for takeoff. The PIC set the takeoff thrust while the co-pilot 
as pilot flying controlled the direction of the aircraft. The PIC call “80” to the co-pilot 
as the aircraft’s speed passed 80 knots. At a speed of approximately 125 kts, the PIC 
noticed a vibration on the aircraft and the acceleration discontinued. The PIC elected 
to abort the takeoff by retarding both thrust levers to idle and selecting to reverse 
thrust. The co-pilot reported that he noticed the speed brake lever extended and the 
auto brake disarm light illuminated, while the aircraft speed decelerated through 80 
knots. 
The PIC controlled the aircraft to keep it on the centreline by using the rudder pedal. 
The aircraft decelerated and when it reached the normal taxi speed, the PIC turned the 
aircraft to the left into the runway turning area. He intended to taxi the aircraft back to 
the apron. An airport security officer who was close to the aircraft and witnessed the 
incident, gave a hand signal to the PIC indicating that taxi should not be continued. 
The PIC stopped the aircraft on the runway turning area. Both left tires were severely 
damaged. Both right main wheel tires deflated as the fuses had melted by overheat. 
Part of the left main landing gear door detached.

from Timika, Papua. 
The last flight of the day was a return flight from Timika to Ewer, about 36 minutes 
each way. The copilot was the handling pilot for the flight sector from Ewer to 
Timika, and the PIC was the support/monitoring pilot. 
The PIC reported that the aircraft commenced sliding before brakes release, and 
shortly after commencing the take-off roll the aircraft veered to the right, so he took 
over control from the copilot. However, he was unable to prevent the aircraft from 
swinging to the left and it rolled through the centreline to the left side of the runway. 
The PIC aborted the take off and attempted to regain the runway centreline from the 
left using nose-wheel steering. That attempt was unsuccessful, and the aircraft veered 
further left and slid off the runway into wet soft ground on the edge of the marsden 
matting runway. It came to a stop 360 meters from the departure end of the runway on 
a heading of 190 degrees. 
The PIC shut down the engines and instructed the copilot to disembark the 
passengers. None of the aircraft’s occupants were injured. 
The investigation was unable to determine why the pilots were unable to maintain 
directional control during the take-off roll. It is likely that in taking control from the 
copilot, and using nose-wheel steering, the PIC may have over corrected, resulting in 
a loss of directional control. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) made recommendations to 
the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to require aircraft operators to 
ensure that airstrips in remote locations have an effective means of communicating 
with regional authorities in the event of an accident or serious incident. 
The NTSC also recommended that the DGCA require Indonesian airport operators to 
inspect the marsden matting runway and ensure that there are no exposed locating 
pins or other objects that could present a hazard to aircraft, and that traction can be 
assured in wet conditions.

operated by Express Air flight number Express 9000, was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Manado to Fak-Fak, Papua via Sorong. The flight 
departed from Manado at 21:15 UTC (06:15 WIT) with an estimated arrival time at 
Fak-Fak of 01:33 UTC. There were 36 people on board; consist of three pilots, one 
cabin crew, and 32 passengers. 
The aircraft touched down heavily approximately 5 meters before the touch-down 
area of runway 10 at Torea Airport, Fak-Fak at 01:33. The investigation found that 
the left main landing gear touched the ground first (5 meters before the end of the 
runway), and the right main landing gear touched the ground (4.5 meters from the 
end of the runway). 
It stopped on the runway, approximately 700 meters from the touch-down area. The 
left main landing gear fractured in two places; at the front pivot point, and the aft 
pivot point. The left fuselage contacted the runway surface 200 meters from the 
touch-down point and the aircraft slid with the left fuselage on the ground for a 
further 500 meters, before it stopped at the right edge of the runway. The wing tip 
and left propeller blade tips also touched the runway and were damaged. 
The passengers and crew disembarked normally; there were no injuries. 
Following an inspection of the landing gear and temporary replacement of the 
damaged left main landing gear, the aircraft was moved to the apron on 8 November 
2008 at 04:00. The runway was closed for 5 days. 
The Digital Flight Data Recorder data showed evidence that the aircraft descended 
suddenly and rapidly when it was on short final approach. About 65 seconds before 
ground impact, the RPM of both propellers commenced to decrease to approximately 
70% with the NH increasing to 85%. Propeller RPM then suddenly reduced, 
followed by an immediate and rapid increase of propeller RPM to 111% left and 
97% right, then just as sudden and rapid, the left propeller RPM reduced to 77% and 
the right to 80%. Given that the propellers are constant speed units, the sudden and 
rapid changes could not be explained other than the probability that a crew member 
had made the control inputs. 
The PIC (pilot monitoring/flight instructor) did not monitor the operation of the 
aircraft sufficiently to ensure timely and effective response to the pilot induced 
excessive sink rate. 
The pilots did not communicate appropriately during the approach and landing, 
resulting is poor crew resource management (CRM). There was no evidence that any 
of the pilots had completed any form of CRM training for more than 9 years. Other 
than the handling pilot, there was no evidence that the other pilots had completed 
ALAR/CFIT training. 
The operator did not have a Line Operations Safety Audit Program (LOSA), and the 
airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standard with respect to runway end safety 
areas. 
Safety action taken following the accident involved the airport authority raising the 
level of the undershoot area to the same level as the runway, and the aircraft operator 
providing the pilots with further flight training. 
The NTSC made a number of recommendations covering the following: crew 
resource management implementation training; the use of the Flight Safety 
Foundation (FSF) Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction awareness training

two passengers who were Susi Air employees. 
The aircraft was refuelled with the Jet A-1 type fuel; total fuel on board was 132 liters. 
After departure from Halim Airport, the pilot reported tracking via BUANA at 7,000 feet. 
Bandung Control instructed the pilot to track on the 315 degree radial of the Bandung 
VOR. The pilot was subsequently cleared to continue climbing to his requested level 9,500 
feet. The pilot informed investigators that when he was approaching 8,700 feet, the engine 
power reduced to 75% and the ECU A inoperative indicator illuminated. That was followed 
by the ECU B inoperative indicator illuminating. The engine failed at 9,200 feet. 
The pilot said that he tried to restart the engine with various combinations of power settings 
and electrical load. No power developed and the propeller continued to windmill. The pilot 
was unable to restart the engine. 
At 0530 UTC the pilot conducted a forced landing at the Infantry Training Center

registered PK-LMS, was being operated on a scheduled passenger service from 
Jakarta Soekarno–Hatta Airport to Juanda Airport, Surabaya. There were 174 
persons on board; three pilots, four flight attendants, and 167 passengers. 
The pilot flying was a candidate First Officer (copilot) under training, and the Pilot 
in Command (PIC) was the instructor acting as the support/monitoring pilot. One 
qualified copilot occupied the jump seat in the cockpit. 
The pilots subsequently reported that the approach to Surabaya was normal. 
The crew of an aircraft holding at the runway intersection reported that a main 
wheel detached from LMS as it touched down. 
The crew of LMS taxied the aircraft to the apron, and during the transit check 
found that the number-two main wheel (left inboard main landing gear) was not on 
the aircraft. The wheel was subsequently found on the runway shoulder, on the 
right side of the runway. 
None of the aircraft’s occupants were injured and they disembarked normally. 
The investigation found that the worn inner threads of the axle number two (left 
main landing gear) caused the detachment of the axle nut and the separation of the 
wheel from the axle wheel number two. The strength and tightness of the thread 
joint could not be assured by the magnitude of tightening torque. 
The power source to the aircraft’s flight recorders was left on during the ground 
inspection immediately following the serious incident, so all cockpit voice data was 
overwritten and not available to the investigation. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) issued recommendations to 
PT. Wings Abadi Airlines during the investigation to inspect the fleet to ensure the 
serviceability of landing gear axle threads. The NTSC also recommended that the 
airline should promulgate procedures requiring flight crew and maintenance 
personnel to deactivate the power source to flight recorders as soon as practicable 
after an accident or serious incident. The NTSC also urged the DGCA to ensure 
that Indonesian operators have flight recorder deactivation procedures and they are 
implemented."

When the aircraft entered Palembang’s Controlled Airspace, the crew was instructed to 
descend to 2,500 feet for the VOR/DME approach to runway 29. 
At 00:30 the PIC reported that he had the runway insight after assured the co-pilot that they 
all have seen the runway. The Aerodrome Controller gave the crew the clearance to land. 
The co-pilot was concentrating on instrument scanning during approach by following the 
VOR radial. He wanted to improve his ability to fly manual during an instrument approach. 
The PIC then rechecking whether any item that has been missed prior to land. 
The ATC saw that the aircraft was not on the approach path properly and came close to the

scheduled passenger service from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta to Sultan 
Thaha Airport, Jambi with flight number SJY 062. On board on this flight were two pilots, 
four flight attendants, and 124 passengers. 
The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in Command (SIC) 
acted as the Pilot Monitoring (PM). 
The flight time from Jakarta to Jambi estimated about one hour and the aircraft was 
dispatched with approximate for 4 hours of fuel endurance. At 09:18 UTC the SIC contacted 
Thaha Tower controller and reported that the aircraft was descending and passing FL160 and 
has been cleared by Palembang Approach control to descend to 12,000 feet. The PIC flew the 
aircraft direct to intercept the final approach runway 31. While descending through 2500 feet 
and about 8 miles from the VOR, the flap one degree and flap 5° were selected. Subsequently 
the landing gear extended and flap 15° was selected. 13 seconds after flap 15 selection, the 
pilots noticed that the hydraulic system A low pressure warning light illuminated, and also the 
hydraulic system A quantity indicator showed zero. The PIC continued the approach and 
adived the SIC that he aimed to fly the aircraft slightly below the normal glide path in order to 
get more distance available for the landing roll. 
The aircraft touched down at 0930 UTC , and during the landing roll the PIC had difficulty to 
select the reversers while applying manual braking. The aircraft drifted to the right of the 
runway centre line about 200 meters prior went out of the runway, stopped at about 120 
meters from the end of the runway 31 on a surface 6 meters below the runway surface. Three 
farmers who were working on that area hit by the aircraft and seriously injured. 
All crew and passengers safely evacuated the aircraft. No significant property damage was 
reported 
The SSCVR and SSFDR were good, examined and subsequently downloaded using the ATSB 
facilities. 
The contributing factors were as the following of: 
The Loss of Hydraulic System A occurred requires the pilots to refere the QRH. At the 
time of occurrence, the pilots has sufficient time to do the procedure and determine all 
the consequences prior to land the aircraft. However the pilot did not use the QRH 
which will assist and guide with the detail of procedures and steps to do before decision 
to land was made, therefore the KNKT recommends that the operator shall ensure that 
pilots when facing the non normal situation should use the QRH and other references 
procedures. 
Crew Resource Management is the application of team management concepts and the 
effective use of all available resources to operate a flight safely and in addition to the 
vi crew, it includes all other groups routinely working with the aircrew are involved in 
decision required to operate a flight. In fact, there was no discussion concerning to the 
non normal situation as described on the CRM before decision to land was made. 
At the time of issuing this final report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi

NduNdu, Papua, The flight was to be operated in accordance with the visual flight 
rules (VFR), remaining clear of cloud and navigating visually. 
The aircraft did not arrive at NduNdu and pilots of search aircraft reported hearing 
PK-RCZ’s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal, but were unable to reach the 
crash site due to the weather conditions. 
At 2020 (0520 local time on Sunday 10 August), the aircraft wreckage was found at 
an elevation of 6,400 feet at the coordinates 03° 26’ 08” S, 138° 21’ 58” E, in the area 
of NduNdu Pass, on the aircraft’s planned track. The crash site was about 200 feet to 
the left (east) of the southerly track across the Pass, on the slope of an 11,000 foot 
mountain. The coordinates and elevation of the lowest point in the NduNdu Pass were 
03° 26’ 26” S, 138° 21’ 22” E and 5,700 feet. 
The pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured. 
The investigation determined that PK-RCZ departed from Taipe II for NduNdu in 
accordance with the visual flight rules. However, the weather in the NduNdu Pass 
area was reported to have been cloudy. 
The investigation determined that it is likely that the pilot continued flying towards 
the Pass towards the NduNdu aerodrome in instrument meteorological conditions 
(IMC). The aircraft impacted the mountain slope to the east of the Pass while cruising. 
The impact was severe and the accident was not survivable. "

on a scheduled passenger service from Soekarno–Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Syamsudin 
Noor Airport, Banjarmasin. There were 121 persons on board; two pilots, five flight 
attendants, and 114 passengers including one child and two infants. 
The pilots reported that the touchdown was normal. When the aircraft slowed to about 
60 knots, the pilot in command (PIC) applied manual braking and shortly after, the 
ANTI SKID INOP light illuminated. The PIC then performed the standard memory 
items of the Emergency Check List, and continued taxiing to the apron. As the PIC 
turned the aircraft to the right to enter taxiway B he heard a sound that he associated 
with a tire bursting, so he stopped the aircraft. 
Engineers who inspected the aircraft on the apron, prior to the passengers 
disembarking, informed the PIC that the number-one main landing gear axle was 
broken, and detached from its strut. The number-two tire had burst. 
None of the aircraft’s occupants were injured, and they disembarked normally using 
airstairs. 
The investigation found that an undetected fatigue crack in the number-one main 
landing gear axle had originated from a corroded hole in the brake assembly 
attachment flange. The fatigue crack propagated toward the flange and the axle wall, 
reaching a length of about 6 cm before a fast final fracture occurred. 
On 5 August 2008, the operator’s maintenance organization issued engineering orders 
that required increased inspection schedules for Boeing 737 main landing gear axles, 
because the axle had failed at a time significantly short of the manufacturer’s 
specified component life. 
On 6 August 2008, the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) issued 
recommendations to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the US Federal 
Aviation Administration, the Boeing Company, and the European Aviation Safety 
Agency, with respect to reviewing the overhaul and inspection requirements for 
Boeing 737 main landing gear axles. 
On 20 July 2009, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) informed the 
NTSC that “Boeing plans to revise the AMM [Aircraft Maintenance Manual] to add 
and highlight the importance of visually inspecting the brake flange location part for 
corrosion and/or damaged Sermetal finish during normal maintenance activities. In 
addition, Summit Aerospace [component overhaul facility] has taken several safety 
enhancement actions by adding a fluorescent penetrant inspection in addition to the 
existing magnetic partial inspection, and revised the relevant magnetic partial 
inspection techniques to enhance the inspection.”"

(07:10 local time) with an estimated arrival time at Medan of 02:25. There were 140 
people on board; two pilots, five cabin crew, and 133 passengers. 
The aircraft touched down towards the departure end of the touch-down area of 
runway 05 at Polonia Airport, Medan at 03:04. After a landing run of 41 seconds, the 
aircraft stopped on the runway adjacent to taxiway ‘D’, approximately 1,200 meters 
from the estimated point of touch down. Three main-wheel tires and two main 
wheels were substantially damaged. The aircraft could not be taxied from the runway 
to the apron, nor could it be towed to the apron due to damage to the wheels. 
The passengers and crew disembarked normally at taxiway ‘D’; there were no 
injuries. 
Following an inspection of the landing gear and replacement of the damaged wheels, 
the aircraft was towed to the apron at 10:10. The runway was closed for about 7 
hours. 
The investigation found that the left landing gear down-lock cable was broken. The 
aircraft touched down with the wheel brakes locked due to a hydraulic lock in the 
system, which was the result of an incorrect manual landing gear extension 
procedure being used by the pilots. 
The pilots’ actions indicated that they did not sufficiently understand the aircraft’s 
landing gear system, resulting in them using inappropriate trouble shooting and 
rectification procedures. 
The pilots were not sufficiently confident of the aircraft’s fuel state to conduct a go 
around and fly past as cleared by ATC.
With the release of the final report, the National Transportation Safety Committee’s 
(NTSC) issued two recommendations to address the safety deficiencies identified in 
the report. These covered flight crew technical knowledge of aircraft systems, fuel

Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang. During the landing at Pangkal Pinang, the aircraft overran 
the end of the runway. The aircraft stopped 50 meters beyond the end of the runway, 
but within the stop-way. 
There were 150 people on board; two pilots, four flight attendants, and 144 
passengers. The aircraft’s occupants were not injured, and disembarked normally 
using air stairs one hour after the aircraft stopped. Based upon crew interviewed, 
airport fire and rescue personnel arrived at the aircraft approximately 10 minutes after 
it stopped. During that 10 minute period, the flight crew were not aware of the extent 
of the damage to the aircraft and if a fire may have started. 
The PIC became distracted by a cabin issue during the approach, and did not 
appropriately monitor the aircraft’s approach profile. The investigation found that the 
aircraft was high and fast on the approach, but the pilot in command allowed the co 
pilot to continue the approach and landing. 
The investigation determined that the approach was un-stabilized, and the flight 
crew’s compliance with procedures, including crew resource management, was not at 
a level to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee issued several recommendations to 
the aircraft operator and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation with the final 
report. These included: a review of airline procedures and flight crew training with 
respect to the timeliness of evacuation of passengers and crew after an accident or 
serious incident, particularly when the extent of damage to the aircraft is not known; a 
review of training programs and procedures with respect to stabilized approaches; and 
the promulgation of procedures requiring flight crew and maintenance personnel to 
deactivate the power source to flight recorders as soon as practicable after an accident 
or serious incident. The NTSC also urged the DGCA to ensure that Indonesian

operated by PT. Manunggal Air, was on an unscheduled freight flight 
from Sentani Airport, Jayapura, to Wamena Airport, Papua. There were 
six people on board; two pilots, one flight engineer, one AME (Aircraft 
Maintenance Engineer), one Mechanic, one FOO (Flight Operation 
Officer). 
The Beta lights did not illuminate during the landing roll at Wamena, so 
reverse thrust could not be used. The pilots used maximum brake action 
to slow the aircraft, and rolled through to the end of runway 15, then 
backtracked the aircraft towards taxiway “E”, about 450 meters from the 
departure end of runway 15. 
The air traffic controller informed the Transall crew that heavy smoke 
was coming from the left main-wheels, and activated the crash alarm. The 
pilots stopped the aircraft on taxiway “E”, and the occupants disembarked 
and attempted to extinguish the wheel-bay fire with a hand held 
extinguisher. 
The airport rescue fire fighting service (RFFS) took 15 minutes to 
commence applying foam to the fire. The attempts to extinguish the fire 
were unsuccessful, and the fire destroyed the aircraft and its cargo of fuel 
in drums. 
The investigation determined that the left main wheels’ brakes overheated 
during the landing roll. Due to the extreme fire damage, the investigation 
was not able to determine the condition of the brake pads at the time of 
the landing, and if that may have contributed to the overheating. 
A fire commenced in the brake area of one or more of the left main 
landing gear wheels. Sections of the left aft main wheels’, inner and outer 
brake disks were substantially damaged, with sections missing; burnt 
away. The investigation was unable to determine the location of the 
source of the fire propellant. It is likely that brake system hydraulic fluid 
under pressure, was the propellant that fed the fire. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee’s report includes 
recommendations to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address 
safety deficiencies to ensure compliance with ICAO Annex 14 
Standards. The safety deficiencies are with respect to the status of the 
RFFS equipment at Wamena, and the need to establish and exercise an

There were 18 persons on board; two pilots, one engineer, and 15 passengers. The 
pilot in command (PIC) was the handling pilot, and the co-pilot was the 
monitoring/support pilot. 
Sugapa weather was clear, with the surface wind calm. The PIC made the approach to 
runway 27 at Sugapa. 
Shortly after touchdown, the aircraft veered to the left and the PIC was unable to 
maintain directional control to keep the aircraft on the runway. The aircraft left the 
runway and struck and fatally injured a man standing close to the edge of the runway. 
The right main wheel sank into soft ground and the aircraft swung abruptly to the 
right through 270 degrees, tearing the nose landing gear from the aircraft. It stopped 
with the nose embedded in an embankment 5 meters from the side of the runway. 
The aircraft was substantially damaged, but the occupants were not injured and 
vacated the aircraft unaided. 
The pilot in command indicated that the aircraft had a history of a tendency to veer to 
left during ground roll. However, investigation found no pre-landing defects with the 
aircraft that could have contributed to the accident. There was also no record of such a 
defect being entered in the aircraft maintenance log. 
The investigation found that the nose landing gear fork cracked and was deformed as 
a result of being subjected to a high impact force during the touchdown.

The Merauke air traffic controller reported that when the aircraft was on final 
approach there were no obstructions on the runway, so he cleared the aircraft to 
land on runway 16. 
During the landing roll, the pilot observed that a cow had entered the active 
runway and was running across the runway in front of the aircraft. When the 
aircraft was about 1,000 meters from the runway 16 threshold, the left engine 
struck the cow. The pilots stopped the aircraft on the runway and shut down the 
left engine. The cabin crew informed the pilots that left engine cowling was 
damaged. 
The aircraft’s occupants were not injured, and disembarked from the aircraft 
unaided, using air stairs at the apron. 
The investigation found that the airport did not meet the requirements of ICAO 
Annex 14, Volume 1, Paragraph 9.10.2, Standard, or the intent of Civil Aviation 
Safety Regulation (CASR) 139 Subparts 4.2 and 4.12.

visual flight procedures, and flew the aircraft into instrument meteorological 
conditions prior to colliding with the terrain. 
As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety Committee 
issued recommendations to address safety issues identified in this report. 
Specifically with respect to the operators pilot training and checking, to ensure 
that it covers the use of the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) (or similar)

A pre-flight check was conducted before takeoff, and no damage or abnormalities were found. The aircraft began its flight at 7:45 AM local time and commenced the fertilizer spreading operation. The loading of fertilizer into the aircraft during the first to the tenth flights proceeded without any issues.

However, during the loading for the eleventh flight, the aircraft took off and experienced an accident at 9:30 AM in the K19 L20 block area. Shortly after the accident, staff from the agronomy/plantation department reported the incident to the technicians in the hangar.

As the aircraft was heading to the fertilization point in the H-20 area and maneuvering at very low altitude, the left wing of the aircraft struck the oil palm trees. This resulted in the left wing breaking and subsequently causing the aircraft to crash.

Due to the accident, the pilot lost their life at the scene of the incident."

operated by PT. Air Transport Service (ATS) on a flight from Makassar to Kasiguncu 
Airport, Poso City, Central Sulawesi. The aircraft departed from Makassar at 00:45 
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and arrived at Kasiguncu at 01:55. There were 6 
occupants; 1 pilot and 5 passengers. 
During the landing on runway 21, the aircraft travelled normally for about 200 meters and 
then suddenly diverged left causing the propeller to strike the runway. Numerous slash marks 
from the three-bladed propeller were found for a distance of 100 meters on the runway. The 
left wing subsequently struck the runway, causing the aircraft to continue turning left through 
90 degrees. The aircraft stopped on the grass shoulder of runway 21. 
The airport’s rescue fire fighting vehicle had been unserviceable since it was damaged during 
riots in 2004. Airport personnel went immediately to the accident site to offer assistance and 
brought portable fire fighting equipment. There was no fire. The pilot and his 5 passengers 
were uninjured. 
The investigation determined that there was no evidence of any defect with the landing gear 
micro switches, or hydraulic system. The investigation was not able to conclusively determine 
the reason the landing gear unlocked and subsequently retracted. 
The NTSC made recommendations to the Kasiguncu Airport operator and the Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation covering the airport emergency equipment, planning and response 
at Kasiguncu Airport."

Pangkal Pinang
Republic of Indonesia","On 16 November 2007, a Cessna 172 aircraft operated by Admal SDN. 
BHD Malaysia, registered 9M-BDI, departed from Hang Nadim Airport, 
Batam, on a ferry flight to Pangkal Pinang (Depati Amir) Airport, Indonesia. 
There were two persons on board. The flight had originated at Subang 
Airport, Selangor, Malaysia and tracked via Johor Bahru and Batam, landing 
at each airport, but only refueling at Batam. 
About an hour after departure from Batam, the pilot reported climbing above 
1,500 feet, and 3 minutes later the pilot broadcast a MAYDAY, stating that 
he was looking for a place to land. At that time he reported that he was 49 
miles from Pangkal Pinang and passing 7,500 feet. The pilot did not give a 
reason for the Mayday broadcast until 5 minutes later. He said that he had 
found a place to land, and then made a passing reference to a fuel leak, and 
that he would refuel and take off from the landing position. The aircraft was 
carrying three jerry cans of avgas in the passenger cabin. 
The pilot subsequently landed on a beach 42 NM north west of Pangkal 
Pinang. During the landing roll the nose wheel sank into soft sand and 
collapsed, resulting in the aircraft overturning. 
The pilot’s passing reference to refuelling and taking off from the forced 
landing position, indicated that following the forced landing he intended to 
refuel from the on-board jerry cans of avgas, and take off from the beach. It 
was evident that the pilot knew that the engine had failed due to fuel 
exhaustion. 
The pilot informed the investigators that he had not leaned the fuel mixture 
during the climb to, and subsequent cruise at 9,000 feet. The investigation 
determined that the pilot did not operate the aircraft in accordance with the 
engine leaning procedures specified by the operator and the aircraft 
manufacturer. If the pilot had used the same procedures for the flight sectors 
from Subang to Johore Bahru and Batam, it is likely that after refueling at 
Batam there was considerably less fuel in the aircraft’s wing tanks than 
estimated by the pilot. 
The investigation determined that under the operating procedures used by the 
pilot, the aircraft did not have sufficient useable fuel on board to complete 
the planned flight when it departed from Batam. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee issued recommendations to 
the operator, Admal Sdn. Bhd. Malaysia, and the Malaysian Department of 
Civil Aviation. The recommendations seek to ensure that appropriate 
guidance documentation, training, and supervision are provided in the areas 
of engine handling/fuel management procedures; the carriage of avgas and 
other dangerous goods in the passenger cabin when carrying passengers; and 
filing of flight plans and other required documents."

Jakarta, was substantially damaged as a result of a severe hard landing sequence at 
Abdurrachman Saleh Airport, Malang, East Java. There were 94 persons on board 
the aircraft, consisting of two pilots, three cabin crew, and 89 passengers. 
The investigation determined that the crew did not refer to the aircraft rate of 
descent when it exceeded 1,000 feet/minute during the landing approach, and was 
therefore an unstabilized approach condition. 
The investigation also determined that the PIC did not respond appropriately to the 
any of ground proximity warning system voice ‘aural warnings that were initiated 
during the latter stages of the approach as a result of the high rate of descent of the 
aircraft. 
The derived FDR data revealed that the aircraft bounced to a height of about 20 
feet after the initial severe hard landing. However, there was no attempt by the 
crew to recover from the high bounce by initiating a go-around. On 2 December 2009, Mandala Airlines informed the NTSC that its safety action 
included issuing a Safety Quality Notice to all pilots stressing required procedures 
for stabilized approach in IMC and VMC. The SQN reinforced previous SQNs 
issued in November 2007 and September 2008, and a 10 November 2007 Mandala 
safety news letter article. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee’s (NTSC) report includes

overran the right side of the runway during the take-off roll. The aircraft left the runway 
and impacted a ditch and rocks on the right shoulder of the runway. Main-wheel tire marks 
for more than 65 meters on the runway indicated that heavy braking action was being 
applied to the left brake. 
A witness statement confirmed the tire track evidence on the runway, that during the early 
take-off roll the aircraft turned right, then left, and then back to the right before leaving the 
runway. The aircraft was substantially damaged. None of the occupants were injured. 
The handling pilot was undergoing captaincy training under the supervision of an 
instructor.
The investigation was unable to determine why the aircraft commenced veering to the right 
during the early acceleration phase of the takeoff. The pilots continued the takeoff and 
directional control was lost during the take-off roll. The instructor pilot was unable to 
regain directional control of the aircraft before it left the runway.
No aircraft or system defect was found that could have contributed to the pilots’ inability 
to maintain directional control during the take-off roll. 
The pilot under training stated that “things happened fast” and he was “unaware that the 
power levers were still in the full on position”, but was “conscious that his left hand was 
on the steering handle”. He said that he did not immediately respond to a shout from the 
instructor to not use the steering handle. 
The investigation considered that it was possible that the nose-wheel steering was not 
centred before commencing the take-off roll and that the pilot under training may have 
been unaware that he was holding an inappropriate nose-wheel steering position during the 
take-off roll. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee made a recommendation to the Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation to review the safety of the Mulia runway shoulder area and 
require the airport operator to ensure that there are no obstacles to safety, such as ditches 
and rocks, to prevent an aircraft from safely negotiating the runway shoulder in the event 
of a runway excursion. "

passenger service, as flight number GA200 from Soekarno-Hatta Airport, Jakarta to 
Adi Sucipto Airport, Yogyakarta. There were two pilots, five flight attendants, and 
133 passengers on board. 
The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 
at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. Yogya Approach cleared the 
aircraft for a visual approach, with a requirement to proceed to long final and report 
runway in sight. Although the crew acknowledged the visual approach clearance, they 
continued with the ILS approach, but did not inform the controller. The descent and 
approach were conducted in visual meteorological conditions. 
At 23:55:33, when the aircraft was 10.1 miles from the runway, it was 1,427 feet 
above the initial fix of 2,500 feet published in the approach chart, and the airspeed was 
283 knots. The pilot in command descended the aircraft steeply in an attempt to reach 
the runway, but in doing so, the airspeed increased excessively. Because the aircraft 
was being flown at speeds that were in excess of the wing flaps operation speed, the 
copilot elected not to extend the flaps as instructed by the PIC. During the approach, 
the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times 
and the copilot called for the PIC to go around. 
The PIC continued the approach with flaps 5 degrees, and the aircraft attained the 
glideslope near the runway 09 threshold. Flaps 5 degrees is not a landing flap setting. 
The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 
knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The wind 
was north easterly at 9 knots. The groundspeed was 235 knots. The aircraft touched 
down at an airspeed of 221 knots, 87 knots faster than landing speed for 40 degrees 
flap. Shortly after touching down, the copilot called, with high intonation, for the PIC 
to go around. 
The aircraft was flown at an excessive airspeed and steep flight path angle during the 
approach and landing, resulting in an unstabilized approach. The PIC did not follow 
company procedures that required him to fly a stabilized approach, and he did not 
abort the landing and go around when the approach was not stabilized.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviationâ€™s flying operations surveillance of Garuda was 
not effective in identifying these and other safety deficiencies. 
The Yogyakarta Airportâ€™s rescue and fire fighting services vehicles were unable to reach 
the accident site and some did not have appropriate fire suppressant. The delay in 
extinguishing the fire, and the lack of appropriate fire suppressant agents, may have 
significantly reduced survivability. The airport emergency plan and its implementation 
were less than effective. 

A number of safety actions by Angkasa Pura I to address safety deficiencies with respect to 
airport emergency preparedness and associated services and equipment are also included. 
Since the accident, an access road between the airport perimeter and the area of the 
accident site has been constructed. 
On 2 April 2007, Garuda issued a notice to its pilots reinforcing its mandatory policy 
relating to a pilot monitoring to take control of an aircraft and execute a go around in 
instances of unstabilized approach, when the pilot flying does not make an appropriate 
response. The notice assures pilots that the company will not take disciplinary measures for 
a go around executed under any unsafe or unstabilized approach. "

Safety Committee of Indonesia, Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore, 
Singapore Navy Divers, and other resources searched for the wreckage of PK-KKW in the 
Makassar Strait, in the vicinity of the last radar return. 
Nine days after the aircraft disappeared, wreckage was found in the water and on the shore 
along the coast near Pare-Pare, Sulawesi. Locator beacon signals from the flight recorders 
were heard on 21 January 2007 and their positions logged. The attempt to recover the 
recorders was suspended when it was determined that the wreckage was located in the 
ocean at a depth of about 2,000 meters, requiring specialized recovery equipment not 
available in the Region. The DFDR data showed that roll rate was momentarily arrested several times, but there was 
only one significant attempt to arrest the roll. Positive and sustained roll attitude recovery 
was not achieved. Even after the aircraft had reached a bank angle of 100 degrees, with the 
pitch attitude approaching 60 degrees aircraft nose down, the pilot did not roll the aircraftâ€™s 
wings level before attempting pitch recovery in accordance with standard operating 
procedures. The aircraft reached 3.5g, as the speed reached Mach 0.926 during sustained 
nose-up elevator control input while still in a right bank. The recorded airspeed exceeded 
Vdive (400 kcas), and reached a maximum of approximately 490 kcas just prior to the end 
of recording. A thump, thump sound was evident on the CVR about 20 seconds from the end of the 
recorded data. Flight recorder data indicated that a significant structural failure occurred 
when the aircraft was at a speed of Mach 0.926 and the flight load suddenly and rapidly 
reversed from 3.5g to negative 2.8 g. This g force and airspeed are beyond the design 
limitations of the aircraft. At the time of the thump, thump sound, the aircraft was in a 
critically uncontrollable state. 
The PIC did not manage task sharing and crew resource management practices were not 
followed. There was no evidence that the pilots were appropriately controlling the aircraft, 
even after the BANK ANGLE alert sounded as the aircraftâ€™s roll exceeded 35 degrees right 
bank. 
This accident resulted from a combination of factors, including the failure of the pilots to 
adequately monitor the flight instruments, particularly during the final 2 minutes of the 
flight. Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System (IRS) diverted 
both pilotsâ€™ attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and 
bank angle to go unnoticed. The pilots did not detect and appropriately arrest the descent 
soon enough to prevent loss of control.
