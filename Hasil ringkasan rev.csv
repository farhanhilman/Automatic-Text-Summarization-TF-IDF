Republic of Indonesia 
","On 22 July 2019, a Cessna 172S registered PK-WUG was being operated by Angkasa
Aviation Academy (AAA) on a mutual flight training exercise from Cakrabhuwana Airport 
(WICD), Cirebon to Indramayu Training Area. The flight plan was filed with cruising altitude 
of 2,000 feet. The exercise for the student pilot was on C-14 Stage which contained exercises 
of mutual precision rate one turns, compass error and performance maneuvers.
Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction. On board 
the aircraft were two student pilots and one of the students acted as Pilot in Command (PIC)
while the other student pilot seated on the right seat. 
At 1358 LT, the PK-WUG aircraft departed from Cirebon to the Indramayu Training Area. 
The Global Positioning System (GPS) installed in the aircraft recorded that when the aircraft 
was flying over the southern boundary of the Indramayu Training Area, the aircraft was 
descending. At 1425 LT, the aircraft flew westerly and was descending passed 750 feet.
The aircraft continued descend and while flew over the Cimanuk River passed 140 feet. 
About one minute flying over the river, the aircraft struck power line cables and crashed into
the river.
After the aircraft stopped, both pilots self-evacuated from the aircraft and helped by local 
people to the river bank. During the evacuation, the Safety Pilot was drowned and fatally 
injured while the PIC had minor injury. 
The investigation determined that the aircraft serviceability was not issue in this accident. The 
investigation concluded the contributing factor of the accident was: 
The available means to monitor flight training activities that had not been utilized 
resulted in the aircraft flying below the minimum safe altitude was undetected.
Flying the aircraft below the minimum safe altitude and unaware of the power line cables

","On 25 May 2019, an Airbus A320 aircraft registered PK-LZJ was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport (WAAA), Makassar 
to Mopah International Airport (WAKK), Merauke. On board the aircraft was two pilots, five 
flight attendants and 82 passengers. 
At 1842 UTC (0242 LT), on night time, the aircraft commenced pushback from stand B1. The 
push back operation used towing tractor with the three crews consisted of towing tractor 
driver, a wing-man and a headset-man who performed by an aircraft mechanic. There was no 
briefing among the crew related to the pushback activity including the push back maneuver. 
The towing tractor driver and wing-man used high visibility vest while the headset-man used 
company uniform without any fluorescence strip or high visibility vest. 
The push back maneuver did not follow the guideline and the headset-man walked behind the 
nose wheel while observing the engine start process. During a turn, the aircraft nose wheel 
passed over the right foot of the headset-man. The towing tractor driver felt a bump and 
noticed that the headset-man laid on the ground. The headset-man evacuated to the nearest 
hospital for medical treatment and found sustaining fracture on his right tarsometatarsal.
The investigation determined that the aircraft and towing tractor airworthiness serviceability, 
and communication transmission were not an issue on this occurrence. Therefore, the analysis 
discussed the pushback operation and personnel awareness. The investigation concluded the 
contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:
The different assumption of pushback maneuver between headset-man and the push back 
tractor driver, and both were fixated to their own duties while working on a reduced 
alertness condition, resulted in the towing tractor driver did not aware of the headset-man 
position and the headset-man did not aware of the nose wheel position. These conditions led 
to the nose wheel passed over the headset-man foot.
The KNKT had been informed of safety actions taken by the involved parties resulting from 
this occurrence. However, there still remain safety issues that need to be considered. 
Therefore, the KNKT issues the following safety recommendations addressed to the Angkasa 
Aviasi Servis

At 1842 UTC (0242 LT), on night time, the aircraft commenced pushback from stand B1. The push back operation used towing tractor with the three crews consisted of towing tractor driver, a wing-man and a headset-man who performed by an aircraft mechanic. The towing tractor driver and wing-man used high visibility vest while the headset-man used company uniform without any fluorescence strip or high visibility vest. The push back maneuver did not follow the guideline and the headset-man walked behind the nose wheel while observing the engine start process. The headset-man evacuated to the nearest hospital for medical treatment and found sustaining fracture on his right tarsometatarsal. The investigation concluded the contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:The different assumption of pushback maneuver between headset-man and the push back tractor driver, and both were fixated to their own duties while working on a reduced alertness condition, resulted in the towing tractor driver did not aware of the headset-man position and the headset-man did not aware of the nose wheel position"

Republic of Indonesia
","On 11 August 2018, a PAC 750XL aircraft registered PK-HVQ was being operated by PT. 
Marta Buana Abadi (Dimonim Air) on unscheduled passenger flight from Tanah Merah to 
Oksibil. At the day of the occurrence the meteorological condition at Oksibil was below the 
requirement of Visual Flight Rule (VFR) weather minima and did not improve. Being aware 
that some flights had performed flight to Tanah Merah to Oksibil and returned, the pilot 
decided to fly to Oksibil. 
At 1342 LT, on daylight condition the PK-HVQ aircraft departed from Tanah Merah to 
Oksibil, on board the aircraft were one pilot, one observer pilot and 7 passengers. According 
to the passenger and cargo manifest, the total weight of passenger and the baggage were 473 
kg. Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction.
At 1411 LT, the PK-HVQ pilot made initial contact to Oksibil Tower controller and reported 
that the aircraft was maintaining altitude of 7,000 feet over and the estimate time arrival at 
Oksibil would be 0520 UTC (1420 LT). The Oksibil Tower controller advised the pilot of the 
latest meteorological condition that the visibility was 1 up to 2 km and most of the area were 
covered by cloud.
At 1416 LT, the pilot reported that the aircraft position was over Oksibil Aiport and the 
Oksibil Tower controller instructed the pilot to continue the flight to the final runway 11 and 
to report when the runway had in sight.
The Oksibil Tower controller and pilots of other aircraft called the pilot but no reply. On the 
following day, the aircraft was found on a ridge of mountain about 3.8 Nm north west of 
Oksibil on bearing 331° with elevation about 6,800 feet. Eight occupants were fatally injured 
and one occupant was seriously injured. 
Investigation involved Transport Accident Investigation Commission of New Zealand and 
Transportation Safety Board of Canada that assigned accredited representative according to 
the ICAO Annex 13.
The investigation determined the contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:
VFR weather minimum requirement that was not implemented properly most likely had 
made the pilot did not have a clear visual to the surrounding area. 
Considering that the Pilot in Command (PIC) had lack knowledge of the terrain 
surrounding the Oksibil area, and the absence of voice alert from the TAWS when the 
aircraft flying close to terrain, resulted in the PIC did not have adequate awareness to the 
surrounding terrain while flying into clouds and continued to fly below the terrain height 
until the aircraft impacted the terrain.
The KNKT acknowledged the safety action taken by the related parties and considered the 
actions were relevant to improve safety, however, there still remain safety issues that need to 
be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations addressed to the 
Dimonim Air, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), and Badan Meteorologi 
Klimatologi dan Geofisika/Bureau of Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG).

At 1416 LT, the pilot reported that the aircraft position was over Oksibil Aiport and the Oksibil Tower controller instructed the pilot to continue the flight to the final runway 11 and to report when the runway had in sight. Investigation involved Transport Accident Investigation Commission of New Zealand and Transportation Safety Board of Canada that assigned accredited representative according to the ICAO Annex 13. The investigation determined the contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:VFR weather minimum requirement that was not implemented properly most likely had made the pilot did not have a clear visual to the surrounding area. Considering that the Pilot in Command (PIC) had lack knowledge of the terrain surrounding the Oksibil area, and the absence of voice alert from the TAWS when the aircraft flying close to terrain, resulted in the PIC did not have adequate awareness to the surrounding terrain while flying into clouds and continued to fly below the terrain height until the aircraft impacted the terrain. The KNKT acknowledged the safety action taken by the related parties and considered the actions were relevant to improve safety, however, there still remain safety issues that need to be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations addressed to the Dimonim Air, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), and Badan Meteorologi Klimatologi dan Geofisika/Bureau of Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG)"

Republic of Indonesia

","On 25 May 2019, an Airbus A320 aircraft registered PK-LZJ was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport (WAAA), Makassar 
to Mopah International Airport (WAKK), Merauke. On board the aircraft was two pilots, five 
flight attendants and 82 passengers. 
At 1842 UTC (0242 LT), on night time, the aircraft commenced pushback from stand B1. The 
push back operation used towing tractor with the three crews consisted of towing tractor 
driver, a wing-man and a headset-man who performed by an aircraft mechanic. There was no 
briefing among the crew related to the pushback activity including the push back maneuver. 
The towing tractor driver and wing-man used high visibility vest while the headset-man used 
company uniform without any fluorescence strip or high visibility vest. 
The push back maneuver did not follow the guideline and the headset-man walked behind the 
nose wheel while observing the engine start process. During a turn, the aircraft nose wheel 
passed over the right foot of the headset-man. The towing tractor driver felt a bump and 
noticed that the headset-man laid on the ground. The headset-man evacuated to the nearest 
hospital for medical treatment and found sustaining fracture on his right tarsometatarsal.
The investigation determined that the aircraft and towing tractor airworthiness serviceability, 
and communication transmission were not an issue on this occurrence. Therefore, the analysis 
discussed the pushback operation and personnel awareness. The investigation concluded the 
contributing factors of the occurrence as follows:
The different assumption of pushback maneuver between headset-man and the push back 
tractor driver, and both were fixated to their own duties while working on a reduced 
alertness condition, resulted in the towing tractor driver did not aware of the headset-man 
position and the headset-man did not aware of the nose wheel position. These conditions led 
to the nose wheel passed over the headset-man foot.
The KNKT had been informed of safety actions taken by the involved parties resulting from 
this occurrence. However, there still remain safety issues that need to be considered. 
Therefore, the KNKT issues the following safety recommendations addressed to the Angkasa 
Aviasi Servis

Prior to departure, the pilot received the flight documents from the Flight Operation Officer (FOO) and no briefing related to the closing of Susilo Airport and moved to Tebelian Airport. The pilot reviewed the Notice to Airman (NOTAM) related to Sintang Aerodrome and notedsome changes airport data of such as elevation, threshold runway elevation and Non Directional Beacon (NDB) identification and frequency. The pilot compared the changes of the Sintang Aerodrome information with the information contained on the Airport Visual Guidance (AVG) provided by the aircraft operator which published on 2 March 2018 and effective since 9 March 2018. In this preliminary investigation report, KNKT issue safety recommendations to Wings Abadi Airline and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to address identified safety issues"
7,8,19-Apr,KNKT.17.11.33.04,Cessna 172S,21-Nov-17,"Near NAMP ISLAND, West Nusa Tenggara
Republic of Indonesia","On 21 November 2017, a Cessna 172S aircraft registered PK-BYK was being operated by 
Balai Pendidikan dan Pelatihan Penerbangan Banyuwangi (BP3B) on a cross country training 
flight from Blimbingsari airport (WADY), Banyuwangi to Sultan Muhammad Kaharuddin 
airport (WADS), Sumbawa Besar. 
On board the PK-BYK were two student pilots. The Student Pilot 1 (SP1) acted as Pilot 
Flying (PF) and the Student Pilot 2 (SP2) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). Prior to departure 
there was no report or record of aircraft system malfunction. 
The PK-BYK departed from Banyuwangi with intention to cruise at altitude of 7,000 feet and 
when approached point KUBU TAMBAHAN, the PK-BYK pilot requested to Bali approach 
controller to climb to altitude of 9,000 feet and was approved.
At the same day, an ATR72-600 aircraft registered PK-WHS was being operated by PT. 
Wings Abadi Airlines (Wings Air) as a scheduled passenger flight from Sumbawa to Lombok 
International Airport (WADL), Nusa Tenggara Barat with flight number WON1861. Prior to 
departure there was no report or record of aircraft system malfunction.
The WON1861 departed from Sumbawa with cruising altitude of 8,000 feet. On board the 
aircraft were two pilots, two flight attendants and 62 passengers, the Pilot in Command (PIC) 
acted as PM and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as PF. 
When the PK-BYK aircraft approaching point NAMP ISLAND, the PK-BYK PF saw an 
ATR72-600 aircraft flew through clouds from the opposite direction with aircraft nose 
slightly up. The PK-BYK PF assumed that the ATR72-600 aircraft was on climbing and then 
the PF decided to descend with intention to avoid the ATR72-600 aircraft.
The separation of both aircraft reduced to below minima when the PK-BYK pilot left altitude 
9,000 feet at 01:31:40 UTC, the distance of both aircraft was 4.7 Nm and continued reducing. 
Both flights continued their flight to the destination safely. The aircraft was undamaged and 
no one injured in this occurrence.
The investigation determined that the aircraft and radio communication serviceability were
not issues in this occurrence and the investigation concluded the contributing factor was the 
assumption of ATR72-600 on climbing and not aware of the right of way rules resulted in the 
PK-BYK pilot decided to descend aircraft for traffic avoidance.
The KNKT had been informed corrective action taken by the AirNav Indonesia and BP3B
responding to the KNKT safety recommendation in the preliminary report. The KNKT 
acknowledged the corrective actions and considered relevant to address the safety issue 
described in this report. Therefore, KNKT did not issue safety recommendation in this report.

The PK-BYK departed from Banyuwangi with intention to cruise at altitude of 7,000 feet and when approached point KUBU TAMBAHAN, the PK-BYK pilot requested to Bali approach controller to climb to altitude of 9,000 feet and was approved. Wings Abadi Airlines (Wings Air) as a scheduled passenger flight from Sumbawa to Lombok International Airport (WADL), Nusa Tenggara Barat with flight number WON1861. On board the aircraft were two pilots, two flight attendants and 62 passengers, the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as PM and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as PF. When the PK-BYK aircraft approaching point NAMP ISLAND, the PK-BYK PF saw an ATR72-600 aircraft flew through clouds from the opposite direction with aircraft nose slightly up. The separation of both aircraft reduced to below minima when the PK-BYK pilot left altitude 9,000 feet at 01:31:40 UTC, the distance of both aircraft was 4. The investigation determined that the aircraft and radio communication serviceability werenot issues in this occurrence and the investigation concluded the contributing factor was the assumption of ATR72-600 on climbing and not aware of the right of way rules resulted in the PK-BYK pilot decided to descend aircraft for traffic avoidance. The KNKT had been informed corrective action taken by the AirNav Indonesia and BP3Bresponding to the KNKT safety recommendation in the preliminary report"
8,9,19-May,KNKT.17.04.10.04,Cessna 208,12-Apr-17,"Anem Mountain, Oksibil
Republic of Indonesia ","On 12 April 2017, a Cessna C208 aircraft registered PK-FSO was being operated by PT. 
Spirit Avia Sentosa (FlyingSAS) for unscheduled cargo flight from Tanah Merah to Oksibil. 
At 1144 LT on daylight condition, the aircraft departed Tanah Merah with intended cruising 
altitude of 7,000 feet. Prior to departure, there was no report or record of aircraft system 
malfunction. On board the aircraft was one pilot, 1,225 kg of general cargo and 800 pounds of 
fuel which was sufficient for about 3 hours of flight time. 
At about 29 Nm from Oksibil, the PK-FSO aircraft passed a Cessna 208B aircraft which was 
flying on opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanah Merah at altitude 6,000 feet. The Cessna 
208B pilot advised to the pilot on radio frequency 122.7 MHz that the PK-FSO aircraft was in 
sight. The pilot responded that the aircraft was maintaining 7,000 feet on direct route to 
Oksibil.
At 1240 LT, the Oksibil tower controller received another phone call from the FlyingSAS 
officer at Jakarta which informed that the FlyingSAS flight following system received SOS 
signal (emergency signal)from PK-FSO aircraft which located approximately 6 Nm north of 
Oksibil. Afterwards, the Oksibil air traffic controller advised the occurrence to the Search and 
Rescue Agency.
On 13 April 2017, at 2211 UTC, the PK-FSO aircraft was found on ridge of Anem Mountain 
which located about 7 Nm north of Oksibil. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and 
the pilot was fatally injured. 
The investigation determined that the aircraft serviceability was not issue in this occurrence. 
Therefore, the analysis discussed the aircraft flight profile; pilot medical condition and 
activities; organization oversight; and pilot medical examination. The investigation concluded 
the contributing factor of the accident was the possibility of the pilot being fatigue, physical 
and environment condition increased pilot sleepiness which might have made the pilot 
inadvertently falling asleep indicated by no pilot activity. The absence of GA-EGPWS aural 
alert and warning was unable to wake up the pilot.
The KNKT has been informed safety actions taken by the FlyingSAS and Balai Kesehatan 
Penerbangan (Aviation Medical Center) resulting from this occurrence, however, there still 
remain safety issues that need to be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety 
recommendations addressed to the FlyingSAS, Aviation Medical Center and Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation.

At about 29 Nm from Oksibil, the PK-FSO aircraft passed a Cessna 208B aircraft which was flying on opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanah Merah at altitude 6,000 feet. At 1240 LT, the Oksibil tower controller received another phone call from the FlyingSAS officer at Jakarta which informed that the FlyingSAS flight following system received SOS signal (emergency signal)from PK-FSO aircraft which located approximately 6 Nm north of Oksibil. On 13 April 2017, at 2211 UTC, the PK-FSO aircraft was found on ridge of Anem Mountain which located about 7 Nm north of Oksibil. The investigation concluded the contributing factor of the accident was the possibility of the pilot being fatigue, physical and environment condition increased pilot sleepiness which might have made the pilot inadvertently falling asleep indicated by no pilot activity. The KNKT has been informed safety actions taken by the FlyingSAS and Balai Kesehatan Penerbangan (Aviation Medical Center) resulting from this occurrence, however, there still remain safety issues that need to be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations addressed to the FlyingSAS, Aviation Medical Center and Directorate General of Civil Aviation"

Republic of Indonesia ","On 16 January 2017, a Cessna 172S registered PK-MUA operated by PT. Mandiri Utama 
Flight Academy on a solo flight training area from Blimbingsari Airport (WADY), 
Banyuwangi to Panggang Bay training area and return to Blimbingsari. 
After returned from the area up to the final approach runway 08, the approach was normal 
refer to the training provided and the student pilot requested for full stop landing.
At 0317 UTC, before touchdown the student pilot flared out and the aircraft ballooning.
The student pilot pushed the control column slightly. The aircraft nose down and the 
propeller hit the runway. The student pilot action to recover the ballooning was contrary to 
the ballooning recovery technique according to the Airplane Flying Handbook.
The aircraft stopped and fire appeared on the front right side of the aircraft. The student 
pilot evacuated through the left door. 
The wreckage examination found fuel line broken on the right lower fuselage that most 
likely caused by the impact. The fuel spill from the broken fuel line and the spark that 
possibly created by the friction of the aircraft part with the runway ignited the fire.
The controller saw the condition and notified the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting 
Services (ARFF) by activating the serine and the crash bell. The fire extinguished after 
about 20 minutes and two foam tenders used more than 6,500 liters water and mixed with
foam while it required approximately 400 liters of water for the type of aircraft according 
to the Manual of Standard (MOS) 139. The amount of extinguishing agent and time 
required, indicated that the extinguishing process was not effective.
No one injured in this accident and the aircraft destroyed by impact forces and post impact 
fire. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this accident were:
 The aircraft ballooning recovery technique was contrary to the ballooning recovery 
technique, resulted in the aircraft nose down during impact the runway, broke the fuel 
pipe line and initiated fire.
 The fire extinguishing process was not effective resulted in the aircraft destroyed.
The KNKT issued several safety recommendations to PT. Mandiri Utama Flight Academy,

Republic of Indonesia","On 25 December 2016, an ATR 72-600 aircraft registered PK-WGW was being operated by 
PT. Wings Abadi Airlines (Wings Air) as a scheduled passenger flight from Husein 
Sastranegara International Airport (WICC), Bandung to Ahmad Yani International Airport 
(WAHS), Semarang with flight number WON 1896. On board the aircraft were two pilots, 
two flight attendants and 68 passengers. There was no report or record of aircraft system 
malfunction prior to the departure.
At 1734 LT (1034 UTC), the aircraft departed from Bandung. The Pilot in Command (PIC) 
acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM).
The flight from departure until commencing for landing approach was uneventful. 
At 1121 UTC, the tower controller had visual contact to the aircraft and issued landing 
clearance, the pilot acknowledged the clearance and requested to reduce the approach light 
intensity. The tower controller reduced the light intensity and confirmed whether the intensity 
was appropriate then the pilot affirmed.
At 1124 UTC, the aircraft touched down and bounced. After the third bounce, the pilot 
attempted to go around and the aircraft touched the runway. 
The tower controller realized that the aircraft was not in normal condition and pressed the 
crass bell then informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) personnel by phone 
that there was aircraft accident near the taxiway D. While waiting the assistance, the pilot kept 
the engines run to provide lighting in the cabin.
At 1129 UTC, the tower controller advised the pilot to shut down the engines since the ARFF 
personnel had arrived near the aircraft to assist the evacuation. Passenger evacuation 
completed at approximately 10 minutes after the aircraft stopped. 
No one injured in this accident and the aircraft was substantially damaged. The right main 
landing gear folded inward and the propellers tip of the engine number 2 broken at about 26 
cm from the tip. On the right fuselage of the aircraft, found several dents and punctures.
The investigation determined that the aircraft serviceability was not issue in this occurrence. 
Therefore, the analysis discussed the bounce landing, visual illusion and emergency 
procedure. The investigation concluded the contributing factor of the accident was:
 The visual illusion of aircraft higher than the real altitude resulted in late flare out which 
made the aircraft bounced.
 The unrecovered bounce resulted in abnormal landing attitude with vertical acceleration 
up to 6 g and collapsed the right main landing gear.
Following the investigation, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) has
informed several safety actions and corrective action responding to the KNKT safety 
investigation on the preliminary report taken by PT. Wings Abadi Airlines. The KNKT 
acknowledges the safety actions and did not issue safety recommendation in this report.
Investigation involved Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses pour la Sécurité de l’Aviation

At 1121 UTC, the tower controller had visual contact to the aircraft and issued landing clearance, the pilot acknowledged the clearance and requested to reduce the approach light intensity. The tower controller realized that the aircraft was not in normal condition and pressed the crass bell then informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) personnel by phone that there was aircraft accident near the taxiway D. At 1129 UTC, the tower controller advised the pilot to shut down the engines since the ARFF personnel had arrived near the aircraft to assist the evacuation. The right main landing gear folded inward and the propellers tip of the engine number 2 broken at about 26 cm from the tip. The investigation concluded the contributing factor of the accident was: The visual illusion of aircraft higher than the real altitude resulted in late flare out which made the aircraft bounced.  The unrecovered bounce resulted in abnormal landing attitude with vertical acceleration up to 6 g and collapsed the right main landing gear. Following the investigation, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) hasinformed several safety actions and corrective action responding to the KNKT safety investigation on the preliminary report taken by PT. Investigation involved Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses pour la Sécurité de l’Aviation (BEA), France that assigned accredited representative according to the ICAO Annex 13"

Republic of Indonesia ","The Piper PA28-161 Warrior II, registration PK-PBH on 19 October 2016 was being operated 
by Perkasa Flying School on a dual flight training touch and go exercise in Tunggul Wulung 
Airport (WAHL) Cilacap, Indonesia.
Several days before the accident the student pilot had injured to left hand wrist and the student 
pilot did not report the injury to the flying school nor the flight instructor. The ‘Internal 
Cockpit’ checklist, the pilot required to ensure the fuel selector valve was selected to the Left 
Tank. Subsequently, the ‘Before Take-off’ checklist required the pilots to move the fuel 
selector to the Right Tank. The injury impaired the ability to operate the fuel selector as 
required by the checklist.
At 0030 UTC (0730 LT), the student pilot conducted pre-flight check to the aircraft. The 
student pilot stated that the aircraft was normal and the fuel uplifted was about 190 litres. 
At 0831 LT, the aircraft was lining-up and took off from runway 31. After the aircraft 
airborne, about 300 feet the instructor pilot noticed the engine sound was spooling down. The 
instructor pilot advanced the throttle to increase the engine power however, the engine RPM 
did not increase. Thereafter, the instructor pilot also reached the fuel selector valve with the 
intention to change the fuel selector valve position but the engine RPM continued spooling 
down and the engine quit.
The instructor pilot decided to conduct the force landing on an open area. The instructor pilot 
took the aircraft control and declared mayday due to engine quit with the intention to make 
emergency landing. The controller noticed the aircraft turn right until disappeared behind the 
trees. During descend to the open area, the instructor pilot attempted to restart the engine
without success.
The aircraft landed on paddy field about 1.3 Nm from the beginning of runway 31, on the 
north of the airport. Both pilots survived and self-evacuated the aircraft. The aircraft was 
substantially damage.
The engine ground run test found that if the selection of fuel selector performed more than 3 
seconds after the engine hesitation, the engine would remain hesitation and quit because of the 
engine has been decelerating significantly and the engine unable to suck the fuel from the 
carburettor. The engine ground run test also found that after the fuel in the engine fuel line 
system was exhausted, the engine restart attempt would be success after minimum of 5 restart 
attempts.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors in this occurrence are:
1. The injured left wrist arm might have result to improper selection of the fuel selector 
valve and led to insufficient fuel to the engine during the take-off power resulted in the 
engine hesitation and quit.
2. The engine recovery and restart attempt were unsuccessful that might be due to the time 
availability and the insufficient aircraft altitude.
The KNKT had not received any safety action taken. The KNKT issued safety 
recommendations to the flying school to address safety issues identified in this report.

Several days before the accident the student pilot had injured to left hand wrist and the student pilot did not report the injury to the flying school nor the flight instructor. The ‘Internal Cockpit’ checklist, the pilot required to ensure the fuel selector valve was selected to the Left Tank. Thereafter, the instructor pilot also reached the fuel selector valve with the intention to change the fuel selector valve position but the engine RPM continued spooling down and the engine quit. The instructor pilot took the aircraft control and declared mayday due to engine quit with the intention to make emergency landing. The engine ground run test found that if the selection of fuel selector performed more than 3 seconds after the engine hesitation, the engine would remain hesitation and quit because of the engine has been decelerating significantly and the engine unable to suck the fuel from the carburettor. The engine ground run test also found that after the fuel in the engine fuel line system was exhausted, the engine restart attempt would be success after minimum of 5 restart attempts. The injured left wrist arm might have result to improper selection of the fuel selector valve and led to insufficient fuel to the engine during the take-off power resulted in the engine hesitation and quit. The engine recovery and restart attempt were unsuccessful that might be due to the time availability and the insufficient aircraft altitude"

",Cessna 172P,13-Oct-16,"Cakrabhuwana Airport, Cirebon
Republic of Indonesia","On Thursday, 13 October 2016 Cessna 172P aircraft registered PK-HAN was being 
operated by Aero Flyer Institute on dual flight training exercise. 
The investigation is based on the data collected on site, interview and recorded radio 
communication.
The aircraft experienced runway excursion and stop on the right runway shoulder 
approximately 1,400 meters from the beginning of runway 04 of Cakrabhuwana1
airport (WICD), Cirebon, West Java. 
On board the flight were one instructor pilot and two student pilots. At 14:05 LT (07:05:02 UTC 2), the instructor conducted initial contact with Cakrabhuwana tower controller (Tower) requested for taxi clearance for dual training area to Karang Ampel area. At 14:18 LT, the aircraft took off from runway 04 and maintained runway heading until 1,000 feet. At 14:24 LT, the aircraft reached point Suranenggala which was approximately  North of Cakrabhuwana.
At 15:11 LT, the Tower called to the instructor pilot and instructed to return to 
Cakrabhuwana as requested by the company with the reason of decreasing weather
condition. The aircraft left Karang Ampel training area immediately after called by 
the Tower.
At 15:16 LT, the aircraft reached point Suranenggala. All the training exercises were
conducted by the student pilots until the landing preparation. 
At 15:20 LT, the aircraft entered the left downwind runway 04 at altitude of 1,500 
feet. The student pilot instructed by the Tower to follow the traffic ahead (PK-AYL) 
which was preparing for landing. During landing, the pilot of PK-AYL reported that 
the wind was gusty.
On the base leg of runway 04, the instructor took over the aircraft control due to the 
wind condition was gusty. 
At 15:23 LT, the aircraft touched down with the flapless configuration. The 
investigation could not define why the aircraft was in the flapless configuration. At
the same time the Tower observed the windsock condition and noticed that the wind 
direction had changed from approximately 360 with the speed of 10 knot to 
approximately 270 with the speed of 10 knot. The Tower witnessed that the aircraft 
was touched down in the middle of the runway 04. The wind change was too rapid 
and the Tower had no time to inform to the instructor as the aircraft was just touched 
down.
The aircraft stop at the right shoulder of the stopway approximately 1,400 meters 
from the beginning of runway 04.
The instructor and two student pilots evacuated from the aircraft. No damage found 
to the aircraft and no one injured in this occurrence.
The instructor had accumulated 700 flying hours and held the valid license. The 
student pilots held valid license.
The Cakrabhuwana Airport was located in the West Java at coordinate 0645’22” S;
10832’18” E with runway length of 1280  30 meters and azimuth of 04 and 22.
The pilot landed prior to the serious incident flight reported gust wind.

The aircraft experienced runway excursion and stop on the right runway shoulder approximately 1,400 meters from the beginning of runway 04 of Cakrabhuwana1airport (WICD), Cirebon, West Java. At 14:05 LT (07:05:02 UTC 2), the instructor conducted initial contact with Cakrabhuwana tower controller (Tower) requested for taxi clearance for dual training area to Karang Ampel area. At 15:11 LT, the Tower called to the instructor pilot and instructed to return to Cakrabhuwana as requested by the company with the reason of decreasing weathercondition. At 15:20 LT, the aircraft entered the left downwind runway 04 at altitude of 1,500 feet. The student pilot instructed by the Tower to follow the traffic ahead (PK-AYL) which was preparing for landing. On the base leg of runway 04, the instructor took over the aircraft control due to the wind condition was gusty. Atthe same time the Tower observed the windsock condition and noticed that the wind direction had changed from approximately 360 with the speed of 10 knot to approximately 270 with the speed of 10 knot. The Cakrabhuwana Airport was located in the West Java at coordinate 0645’22” S;10832’18” E with runway length of 1280  30 meters and azimuth of 04 and 22"
13,14,20-Jul,KNKT.16.09.27.04,Boeing 737-300F,13-Sep-16,"Wamena Airport, Papua Republic of Indonesia","On 13 September 2016, a Boeing 737-300 Freighter, registered PK-YSY was being operated 
by PT. Trigana Air Service on a scheduled cargo flight from Sentani Airport, Jayapura 
(WAJJ) to Wamena Airport, Wamena (WAVV), Papua, Indonesia. On board the aircraft were 
two pilots and one Flight Operation Officer (FOO) as a loadmaster. The flight carried 14,913
kg of cargo. 
The aircraft cruised at altitude 18,000 feet and prior to descend, the pilot observed the weather 
within the criteria of Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC). The pilots able to identify the 
other Trigana flight from Sentani to Wamena in front of them.
The aircraft make orbit in point X which located at 8 Nm from runway 15 to provide 
separation with the aircraft ahead. The aircraft was on sequence number three for landing.
The aircraft ahead safely landed and made the pilot confidence that safe landing would be 
able to be made on the existing weather condition.
About 2,000 feet above airport elevation, the descend approach continued while the weather 
did not meet the visual minima. The pilot reduced the rate of descend twice during the 
descend approach. 
About 1,000 feet above airport elevation, the PM informed to the PF that runway was not in 
sight and advised to go around. About 500 feet above airport elevation, the PF was able to see 
the runway and increased the rate of descend. The pilot noticed that the Enhanced Ground 
Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) aural warning “SINK RATE” active. 
The aircraft touched down approximately 125 meters from the beginning runway 15 with 
vertical acceleration of 3.25 g, the aircraft speed 137 knots, pitch 7° up and roll to the left 5°. 
The calculation of FDR data showed that the rate of descend prior to touch down was 2,300 
feet/minute which was greater than the requirement described on the CASR Part 25.473
Several indications of weather below the visual approach minima, un-stabilized approach, the 
PM suggestion to go around, EGPWS warning, and absence of landing clearance did not 
make the pilot decided to go around. The pilot was sure that he could land the aircraft as the 
previous flight landed safely. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to the accident was refer to the 
previous aircraft that was landed safely, the pilot confidence that a safe landing could be made 
and disregarding several conditions required for go around
Following the accident, the aircraft operator had taken several safety actions. The Komite 
Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) acknowledged the safety actions taken by the 
aircraft operator and considered relevant to prevent similar occurrence. However, KNKT 
identify other safety issues required to be considered and issued safety recommendations to 
aircraft operator","['On 13 September 2016, a Boeing 737-300 Freighter, registered PK-YSY was being operated by PT', 'Trigana Air Service on a scheduled cargo flight from Sentani Airport, Jayapura

Trigana Air Service on a scheduled cargo flight from Sentani Airport, Jayapura (WAJJ) to Wamena Airport, Wamena (WAVV), Papua, Indonesia. The aircraft cruised at altitude 18,000 feet and prior to descend, the pilot observed the weather within the criteria of Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC). The aircraft ahead safely landed and made the pilot confidence that safe landing would be able to be made on the existing weather condition. The calculation of FDR data showed that the rate of descend prior to touch down was 2,300 feet/minute which was greater than the requirement described on the CASR Part 25. 473Several indications of weather below the visual approach minima, un-stabilized approach, the PM suggestion to go around, EGPWS warning, and absence of landing clearance did not make the pilot decided to go around. The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to the accident was refer to the previous aircraft that was landed safely, the pilot confidence that a safe landing could be made and disregarding several conditions required for go aroundFollowing the accident, the aircraft operator had taken several safety actions. The Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) acknowledged the safety actions taken by the aircraft operator and considered relevant to prevent similar occurrence"

","Demak, Central Java","On 20 June 2016, a Cessna C172 aircraft registered PK-NIV was being operated by Nusa 
Flying School on a mutual flight training area from Ahmad Yani International Airport 
(WAHS), Semarang to Wedung area, Demak. 
Before commencing the flight, the student pilots conducted preflight check and there was no 
abnormality of the aircraft systems detected. The fuel quantity indicator indicated 120 liters of 
fuel which was sufficient for two-hour flight. No additional fuel tanked at Semarang. 
At 1249 LT (0549 UTC), the aircraft departed from Semarang with two student pilots on 
board which one of the student pilot acted as Pilot Flying (PF), the other acted as Pilot 
Monitoring (PM). The flight from departure until Wedung Area was uneventful. 
After conducted area training exercise for approximately 55 minutes, the pilots were about to 
return to Semarang and was instructed to hold over Wedung Area and maintain 1,000 feet as 
there was an aircraft returning from Jepara Area to Semarang at altitude 2,000 feet.
While holding, the pilot noticed engine problem indicated by decreasing of the propeller 
rotation and aircraft vibration. The pilot performed procedure for identifying the cause and 
checked the ignition position on BOTH, master switch was ON, carburetor heater on position 
STAND BY, mixture on FULL RICH position and the fuel valve selector was slightly on the 
right of ON/BOTH position. 
The pilot was unable to restart the engine by cranking several times and then elected to make 
emergency landing. The PM then informed to the Semarang Approach controller that they 
were making emergency landing. Another training aircraft then relayed to the Semarang 
Approach controller that PK-NIV performed emergency landing on Wedung Area.
At approximately 0636 UTC, the aircraft landed in a fishpond on Wedung Area, at coordinate 
648’5.64” S 11035’0.66” E, at approximate 16 NM from Semarang on radial 050°.
Both student pilots evacuated with minor injury. The aircraft was substantially damaged. The 
fishpond was contaminated with aircraft fuel.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this accident were:
 The engine failure in flight was caused by improper fuel flow to the engine as the fuel 
selector valve was on intermediate position between BOTH and RIGHT.
 The deviation of understanding to the fuel system had caused the engine failure inflight 
and did not reselect to the proper position when performing check for cause procedure 
and resulted in the failure to restart the engine.
Prior to publish this investigation report, KNKT has been informed safety actions taken by 
Nusa Flying Institute. 
The KNKT issued several safety recommendations to Nusa Flying Institute and Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to address safety issues identified during the investigation.

The KNKT issued several safety recommendations to Nusa Flying Institute and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to address safety issues identified during the investigation"

Republic of Indonesia","On 1 May 2016, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft registered PK-LJR was being operated by PT. 
Lion Mentari Airlines. The aircraft parked at parking stand A33 of Soekarno-Hatta 
International Airport, Jakarta and prepared to continue the flight to Manado as LNI770.
At 1150 UTC (1850 LT), it was dusk light condition, the LNI770 aircraft pushed back from 
parking stand A33 heading to taxiway SC3. The pilot aware that their position was behind an 
Airbus A330 aircraft that was pushing back from parking stand K13 and also heading to 
taxiway SC3. 
The Airbus A330 aircraft registered PK-LEF was being operated by the same company as a 
schedule passenger flight with flight number LNI026 from Jakarta with intended destination 
of Ngurah Rai International Airport, Bali. At 1151 UTC (1851 LT), the LNI026 aircraft
pushed back heading to taxiway SC3 was about to start the engines.
Weather condition at that time was fine and the ground visibility was nine kilometers.
During taxi, the LNI770 pilot deviated to the right from the taxi guideline with intention to 
avoid collision with LNI026. When the LNI770 aircraft position was abeam LNI026 the 
LNI770 pilot felt the aircraft shaking and heard unusual sound.
At that time, the LNI026 pilot just completed engine starting and felt the aircraft shaking. The 
pilots check engine parameters were normal and observed that the LNI770 aircraft was taxiing 
on the right side at position that was very close to the LNI026 aircraft.
The LNI026 pilot by hand signal, requested the ground personnel to reconnect ground 
communication device. After connected, the ground personnel inform that the right wing of 
LNI026 aircraft collided with LNI770. The LNI026 pilot then informed the Soekarno-Hatta 
ground controller that the LNI026 aircraft collided with LNI 770. 
At 1159 UTC, the ground controller advised the LNI770 pilot to stop the taxi. The LNI770 
aircraft position was on taxiway SCX. 
Both aircraft returned to the parking stands and cancelled the flight. No one injured as result 
of this occurrences.
The investigation concerns to several safety issues related to the ground collision between the 
LNI770 and LNI026 aircraft that was on static condition. The aircraft movement analysis was 
based on communication between the air traffic controller, information from interview and the 
damage to the aircraft. The aircraft serviceability was considered not related to the event and 
will not be analyzed. 
The investigation concluded the contributing factor of the serious incident was:
The time pressure to arrive at the destination prior to the end of operating hour led to rush 
situation resulted in mis-judgment while making separation and the wings collided.

Republic of Indonesia","On 28 April 2016, a Cessna 172 G aircraft registered PK-TGL was being operated by Global 
Aviation Flying School on a solo flight training with intention to conduct six touch and go 
exercises in Budiarto Airport, Tangerang. On board the aircraft was one student pilot.
The aircraft departed runway 12 and performed three touch and go exercises uneventful.
On fourth touch and go exercise, while turning final at altitude of approximately 550 feet, the 
student pilot noticed that the aircraft speed was 70 knots. 
When the aircraft position was on short final at speed 70 knots with flaps 3, the aircraft 
position was slightly on the right of final approach path and the student pilot attempted to 
align the aircraft with the runway.
While the aircraft at above the runway threshold, the speed was approximately 60 knots, the 
aircraft yawed to the right and the pitch was slightly lower than the normal approach attitude 
thereafter, the student pilot put the throttle smoothly to idle. The aircraft then touched down 
on the right side of runway centerline with nose wheel touched first and the aircraft continued 
moving to the right then stopped outside the runway pavement.
The aircraft stopped out on the right of runway 12 with approximately 305 meters from the 
beginning runway 12 and 23 meters from runway centerline. Investigation found tire marks 
on the runway surface prior to the aircraft final position.
Recognizing the occurrence, the Budiarto Tower Controller activated the crash bell and 
informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) unit. The ARFF personnel 
immediately deployed to the occurrence site. 
Following the occurrence, the student pilot was taken to the nearest medical facility for 
medical examination and there was no injury or medical issue reported. No one injured on this 
occurrence and the aircraft was not damage.
There were no technical and/or aircraft system abnormality reported or recorded prior to the 
occurrence. Therefore, the analysis will not discuss the aircraft serviceability and will discuss 
the issue on landing technique.
The investigation concluded the contributing factor to this occurrence is focused to regain the 
directional control of the aircraft had delayed the flare out and lack of the rudder application 
resulted in the nose wheel touch down first and constant deviation travel away from the 
runway center line.
At the time of issuing this report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi had been 
informed any safety actions taken by the airport operator resulting from this occurrence.
Following this occurrence, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to Global 
Aviation Flying School to introduce the student pilots with Approach and Landing Accident 
Reduction (ALAR) training and stabilize approach criteria and to emphasized a go around 
shall be made when does not meet the criteria.","['On 28 April 2016, a Cessna 172 G aircraft registered PK-TGL was being operated by Global Aviation Flying School on a solo flight training with

On fourth touch and go exercise, while turning final at altitude of approximately 550 feet, the student pilot noticed that the aircraft speed was 70 knots. When the aircraft position was on short final at speed 70 knots with flaps 3, the aircraft position was slightly on the right of final approach path and the student pilot attempted to align the aircraft with the runway. While the aircraft at above the runway threshold, the speed was approximately 60 knots, the aircraft yawed to the right and the pitch was slightly lower than the normal approach attitude thereafter, the student pilot put the throttle smoothly to idle. The investigation concluded the contributing factor to this occurrence is focused to regain the directional control of the aircraft had delayed the flare out and lack of the rudder application resulted in the nose wheel touch down first and constant deviation travel away from the runway center line. At the time of issuing this report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi had been informed any safety actions taken by the airport operator resulting from this occurrence. Following this occurrence, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to Global Aviation Flying School to introduce the student pilots with Approach and Landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) training and stabilize approach criteria and to emphasized a go around shall be made when does not meet the criteria"

Republic of Indonesia","On 4 April 2016, Boeing 737-800 registration PK-LBS was being operated by Batik Air as 
scheduled passenger flight with flight number ID 7703 from Halim Perdanakusuma Airport
with intended destination Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. An ATR 42-
600 aircraft, registration PK-TNJ operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri was being 
repositioned from north to south apron of Halim Perdanakusuma Airport by a ground 
handling agent PT. Jasa Angkasa Semesta (PT. JAS). The aircraft was towed without aircraft 
electrical power fed to the system including the radio communication and aircraft lighting
system. 
At the time of occurrence, the ID 7703 pilot communicated to Halim Tower controller on 
frequency 118.6 MHz while the towing car driver communicated using handheld radio on 
frequency 152.73 KHz and was handled by assistant controller.
At 1948 LT (1248 UTC), ID 7703 pilot received taxi clearance from Halim Tower controller
and after the ID 7703 taxi, the towing car driver received clearance for towing and to report 
when on taxiway C. Afterward the towing car driver was instructed to expedite and to follow 
ID 7703.
While the ID 7703 backtracking runway 24, the towed aircraft entered the runway intended to 
cross and to enter taxiway G. At 1256 UTC, ID 7703 pilot received takeoff clearance and 
initiated the takeoff while the towed aircraft was still on the runway. The towing car driver 
and the pilots took action to avoid the collision. The decision of the pilot and the towing car 
driver to move away from the centerline runway had made the aircraft collision on the 
centerline runway (head to head) avoided, however the wings collision was unavoidable.
At 1257 UTC, the ID 7703 collided with the towed aircraft. The ID 7703 pilot rejected the 
takeoff and stopped approximately 400 meters from the collision point while the towed 
aircraft stopped on the right of the centerline runway 24.
No one injured at this occurrence and both aircraft severely damaged.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to the accident are:
 Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate 
frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the 
controllers, pilots and towing car driver.
 The communication misunderstanding of the instruction to follow ID 7703 most likely 
contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway.
 The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have 
diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that 
was installed with insufficient lightings.
Following this occurrence, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had been 
informed several safety actions taken by related parties. The KNKT acknowledges the safety
actions taken by the operators and aircraft manufacturer, there still remain safety issues that 
need to be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations addressed to PT.

An ATR 42-600 aircraft, registration PK-TNJ operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri was being repositioned from north to south apron of Halim Perdanakusuma Airport by a ground handling agent PT. At 1948 LT (1248 UTC), ID 7703 pilot received taxi clearance from Halim Tower controllerand after the ID 7703 taxi, the towing car driver received clearance for towing and to report when on taxiway C. The decision of the pilot and the towing car driver to move away from the centerline runway had made the aircraft collision on the centerline runway (head to head) avoided, however the wings collision was unavoidable. The ID 7703 pilot rejected the takeoff and stopped approximately 400 meters from the collision point while the towed aircraft stopped on the right of the centerline runway 24. The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to the accident are: Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the controllers, pilots and towing car driver.  The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that was installed with insufficient lightings. Following this occurrence, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had been informed several safety actions taken by related parties.

Republic of Indonesia","On 20 February 2016, a Boeing 737-900ER aircraft, registration PK-LFG was being operated 
by PT. Lion Mentari Airlines on a scheduled passenger flight from Sepinggan International 
Airport (WALL), Balikpapan East Kalimantan to Juanda International Airport (WARR), 
Surabaya, with flight number LNI263. On board of this flight were two pilots, five flight 
attendants and 215 passengers.
At 0230 UTC (1030 LT) the aircraft departed Sepinggan International Airport, Balikpapan, 
the flight was uneventful until commencing approach to Surabaya.In this flight, the Pilot in 
Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) while the Second in Command (SIC) acted 
as Pilot Flying (PF). 
At 0403 UTC, the pilot received clearance for approach by following the Instrument Landing 
System (ILS) approach procedure runway 10. While the aircraft passing altitude 600 feet, the 
autopilot and auto throttle disengaged and the pilot flew manually.
While the aircraft on final approach, the ATC noticed that the visibility decreased to 1,000 
meters. On short final, the PIC noticed that the SIC had difficulty in control the aircraft and 
assisted the SIC to correct the approach profile. 
At 0407 UTC, the aircraft landed on runway 10 at aproximately 552 meters from the 
beginning runway with speed 9 knots above the target. After touched down, the thrust 
reverser levers could not be selected as the thrust levers were not in idle position, the spoiler 
deployment delayed for about 10 seconds and the brake pressure increased 9 seconds after 
touch down. 
The aircraft overrun and stopped with the nose wheel position at approximately one meter out 
of the pavement. No one injured on this occurrence. There was no damage to the aircraft or to 
property and environment.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are:
 The difficulty to control the aircraft and deteriorating weather did not trigger firm action 
resulted in the combination of lack of communication and leadership.
 The combination of prolong touchdown, delay in spoiler deployment, thrust levers not at 
idle position, and late of brake application had affected the landing distance.
Following this serious incident PT. Lion Mentari Airlines has issued safety actions which 
considered relevant to improve safety. In addition, KNKT issued safety recommendations 
addressed to PT. Lion Mentari Airlines and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

At 0230 UTC (1030 LT) the aircraft departed Sepinggan International Airport, Balikpapan, the flight was uneventful until commencing approach to Surabaya. At 0403 UTC, the pilot received clearance for approach by following the Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach procedure runway 10. While the aircraft passing altitude 600 feet, the autopilot and auto throttle disengaged and the pilot flew manually. At 0407 UTC, the aircraft landed on runway 10 at aproximately 552 meters from the beginning runway with speed 9 knots above the target. After touched down, the thrust reverser levers could not be selected as the thrust levers were not in idle position, the spoiler deployment delayed for about 10 seconds and the brake pressure increased 9 seconds after touch down. The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are: The difficulty to control the aircraft and deteriorating weather did not trigger firm action resulted in the combination of lack of communication and leadership.  The combination of prolong touchdown, delay in spoiler deployment, thrust levers not at idle position, and late of brake application had affected the landing distance"

Republic of Indonesia","On 21 December 2015, an ERJ 190-200 (Embraer 195) aircraft, registered PK-KDC was 
being operated by Kalstar Aviation on a scheduled passenger flight from H. Hasan 
Aroeboesman Airport (WATE) Ende to El Tari Airport (WATT) Kupang with flight number 
KD676. The aircraft departed at 0916 UTC, on board of this flight were two pilots, three 
flight attendants, and 125 passengers. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as pilot monitoring 
(PM) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as pilot flying (PF). 
The voice data did not record any checklist reading and approach briefing performed by the 
crew. Prior to the approach, both pilots discussed that they were going to make RNAV 
approach runway 07 and landing configuration with flap 5 and auto-brake low.
While flew over the initial approach point SEMAU, the aircraft was 2,000 feet above the 
required altitude as described on the instrument approach procedure. The approach path was 
shortened by deviated from published path and used higher speed. 
The aircraft was on higher than the approach profile and the pilots performed non-standard 
configuration setting by extended landing gear down first with intention to increase drag. The 
voice data recorded that after the landing gear extension the flap selected to position 1 and
continued to 2. 
The aural warning “HIGH SPEED” alternately with EGPWS warning “CAUTION 
TERRAIN” and “SINK RATE” active for one minute until touchdown. The aircraft speed 
was about 200 knots or about 62 knots above the target speed when crossing the threshold and 
touched down on the middle of the runway. During the landing roll, the brake pressure was 
relatively low and the thrust reversers were activated. 
The aircraft overrun and stopped at approximately 200 meters from the end of runway 07. 
No one injured on this accident.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to the accident were:

21,22, ,KNKT.15.11.26.04,Boeing 737-900 ER,6-Nov-15,"Adisutjipto International Airport
Yogyakarta, Republic of Indonesia ","On 6 November 2015, a Boeing 737-900ER registration PK-LBO was being operated by PT. 
Batik Air Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta International 
Airport, Jakarta (WIII) to Adisutjipto International Airport, Yogyakarta (WAHH) with flight 
number BTK 6380. The flight departed from Jakarta at 0713 UTC with total person on board 
of 168 people and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in 
Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight from departure until commencing 
approach into Yogyakarta was uneventful and there was no report or record of aircraft system 
abnormality during the flight.
After received meteorological information from Aerodrome Terminal Information Services 
(ATIS) the pilot decided to land with configuration flaps 40 and auto-brake 3. While 
approaching Yogyakarta, the pilots noticed cumulonimbus cloud over Yogyakarta then
decided to follow wind shear precaution recommendation to use flaps 30 for landing.
During Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach runway 09, the pilot received information 
that the runway was wet and decided to change the selection of the auto-brake from three to 
maximum.
The FDR data indicated that at altitude 10 feet the speed was 159 knots and floated for 6 
seconds then touched down at 730 meters from beginning runway 09 on speed 154 knots. The 
aircraft stopped at about 84 meters from end of runway 09 and passenger evacuation initiated 
9 minutes after. No one injured in this accident.
Four conditions affecting the landing distance, specifically the aircraft floated for about 6 
seconds and touched down at 427 meter beyond the aim point, after bouncing once; the 
airspeed at touchdown was 13 knots above Vref, and there was average tailwind of 6 knots; 
the thrust reversers were stowed at a higher than recommended speed and there was little 
braking for about 305 meter after the autobrakes were disconnected; and the wet runway 
conditions resulted in less deceleration.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are: 
 The absence of landing distance calculation following landing reconfiguration and the 
higher speed with no reminder callout might have made the pilots decided to continue 
landing, and
 The conditions of the aircraft floated and eventually touched down at the end of the 
touchdown zone 13 knots above Vref with average 6 knots tailwind, lower brake pressure 
for 305 meter after the autobrakes were disconnected, and removal of the thrust reverser 
application at a higher than recommended speed along with medium braking action had 
extended the landing distance.
The investigation also considered the external factors such as runway condition might have 
contributed to the reducing of deceleration rate while the brake pressure and thrust reversers 
were close to maximum.
Following this accident PT. Batik Air Indonesia has issued 24 safety actions which considered 
relevant to improve safety. In addition, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to 
PT. Batik Air Indonesia, PT. Angkasa Pura Airport branch Adisutjipto International Airport, 
AirNav Indonesia district office Yogyakarta and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.","['On 6 November 2015, a Boeing 737-900ER registration PK-LBO was being operated by PT', 'Batik Air

The flight departed from Jakarta at 0713 UTC with total person on board of 168 people and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). During Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach runway 09, the pilot received information that the runway was wet and decided to change the selection of the auto-brake from three to maximum. The FDR data indicated that at altitude 10 feet the speed was 159 knots and floated for 6 seconds then touched down at 730 meters from beginning runway 09 on speed 154 knots. Four conditions affecting the landing distance, specifically the aircraft floated for about 6 seconds and touched down at 427 meter beyond the aim point, after bouncing once; the airspeed at touchdown was 13 knots above Vref, and there was average tailwind of 6 knots; the thrust reversers were stowed at a higher than recommended speed and there was little braking for about 305 meter after the autobrakes were disconnected; and the wet runway conditions resulted in less deceleration. The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are:  The absence of landing distance calculation following landing reconfiguration and the higher speed with no reminder callout might have made the pilots decided to continue landing, and The conditions of the aircraft floated and eventually touched down at the end of the touchdown zone 13 knots above Vref with average 6 knots tailwind, lower brake pressure for 305 meter after the autobrakes were disconnected, and removal of the thrust reverser application at a higher than recommended speed along with medium braking action had extended the landing distance. The investigation also considered the external factors such as runway condition might have contributed to the reducing of deceleration rate while the brake pressure and thrust reversers were close to maximum"
22,23, ,KNKT.15.10.24.04,Tecnam P2006T Aircraft,20-Oct-15,"Nusawiru Airport, Pangandaran, West Java Republic of Indonesia","A Tecnam P2006T aircraft, registration PK-LTK was being operated by PT. Asian One Air 
on 20 October 2015 as unscheduled solo flight training.The purpose of this flight was to gain 
flight hour for a new recruited pilot. The flight was planned from Husein Sastranegara Airport 
(WICC) Bandung, West Java to Nusawiru Airport (WICN) Pangandaran, West Java and
return to Bandung.
The aircraft departed Husein Sastranegara Airport, Bandung at 0950 LT (0250 UTC), cruised 
at altitude of 7,500 feet and scheduled to arrive Nusawiru Airport at 0310 UTC. The pilot was 
the only occupant in this flight.
There was no aircraft technical system abnormality or problem reported prior to the departure 
until the time of occurrence. The flight from Husein Sastranegara Airport until descend was 
uneventful. 
At 0257 UTC the pilot reported to Nusawiru Aerodrome Flight Information Services (AFIS) 
officer the position over TASIK (Tasikmalaya) at 7,500 feet. 
The weather during approach applicable for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and the wind was 
easterly with velocity of 7 knots. 
There were eight other aircraft flying in the vicinity of the airport which consisted of five 
aircraft conducting area training exercise, one on touch and go training, one departure aircraft 
and one arrival aircraft. There were also two other aircraft on the ground ready for taxi out.
At the about 15 Nm before Nusawiru Airport, the aircraft descended to altitude 2,000 ftthen
direct to final runway 07 for landing. The pilot stated that during on final he set the landing 
configuration and read the checklist. 
At 0316 UTC, the aircraft landed on runway 07 of Nusawiru Airport. After touchdown, the 
pilot informed to the AFIS personnel that the aircraft landing gear was not extended. The pilot 
did not recall activation warning. The pilot shut down engines and evacuated the aircraft. The 
aircraft stop about 400 meters from touchdown point.
No one injured in this serious incident. The aircraft lower fuselage skin and the VOR/DME 
antenna damage.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this serious incident were: 
 The flap full down position with landing gear UP did not trigger the landing gear warning 
lead to the pilot did not aware that the landing gear had not been extended.
 Stress and fatigue might degrade the human performance combined with inappropriate 
checklist execution resulted to the landing gear not extended.
Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi issued safety recommendations to the aircraft 
operator, aircraft maintenance provider, and Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address 
the safety issues identified in this investigation.","['A Tecnam P2006T aircraft, registration PK-LTK was being operated by PT', 'Asian One Air on 20 October 2015 as unscheduled solo flight training',

The aircraft departed Husein Sastranegara Airport, Bandung at 0950 LT (0250 UTC), cruised at altitude of 7,500 feet and scheduled to arrive Nusawiru Airport at 0310 UTC. At 0257 UTC the pilot reported to Nusawiru Aerodrome Flight Information Services (AFIS) officer the position over TASIK (Tasikmalaya) at 7,500 feet. The weather during approach applicable for Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and the wind was easterly with velocity of 7 knots. There were eight other aircraft flying in the vicinity of the airport which consisted of five aircraft conducting area training exercise, one on touch and go training, one departure aircraft and one arrival aircraft. At the about 15 Nm before Nusawiru Airport, the aircraft descended to altitude 2,000 ftthendirect to final runway 07 for landing. The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this serious incident were:  The flap full down position with landing gear UP did not trigger the landing gear warning lead to the pilot did not aware that the landing gear had not been extended.  Stress and fatigue might degrade the human performance combined with inappropriate checklist execution resulted to the landing gear not extended. Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi issued safety recommendations to the aircraft operator, aircraft maintenance provider, and Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address the safety issues identified in this investigation"
23,24,25-Jun-21,KNKT.15.10.23.04,ATR 72-212A,19-Oct-15,"H. Hasan Aroeboesman Airport, Ende
Republic of Indonesia","On 19 October 2015, an ATR 72-600 aircraft, registered PK-GAF was being operated by PT. 
Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from El Tari Airport (WATT), Kupang to 
H. Hasan Aroeboesman Airport (WATE), Ende.
At 0445 UTC, the aircraft departed from Kupang and the flight until commenced for approach 
to Ende was uneventful. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as pilot flying (PF) while Second 
in Command (SIC) acted as pilot monitoring (PM). 
At 0537 UTC, the SIC advised to the Ende Aeronautic Communication Officer (ACO) that 
the aircraft was turning on final runway 27. The ACO responded that the wind direction was 
150° with velocity of 18 knots and advised that the runway was clear. According to pilot 
observation, the weather was clear without scattered cumulus. On short final, the SIC checked 
the wind shock located on the right side of beginning runway and was coherent to the 
information of the wind condition from the ACO.
The aircraft touched down on the touchdown zone with nose wheel touched the runway first 
and bounced to the left of runway centerline. The aircraft then experienced the second 
touchdown on the left shoulder of the runway. During the second bounce, the master warning 
light illuminated consisted with the “Pitch Disconnect” warning on the Engine and Warning
Display (EWD). The flight crew applied significant dual and opposite control columns inputs 
(leading to pitch uncoupling mechanism activation) - pitch down by the PIC on left seat and 
pitch up by the SIC on right seat (pitch up authority is higher).
After the second bounce, the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded an increasing value of 
TQs. The pilot performed a go around and turned right to avoid obstacle at the end of the 
runway 27. Both pilots assessed situation and decided to divert to Labuan Bajo. The flight 
continued uneventfully and landed safely at Labuan Bajo.
The investigation determined that the aircraft airworthiness serviceability was not an issue on 
this occurrence. Therefore, the analysis discusses the landing technique and pilot 
coordination. The investigation concluded the contributing factors of the occurrence as 
follows:
 Continuation of unstabilized approach with too much speed and nose down attitude 
resulted in the nose wheel touched the runway first, and with the roll about 3° to the left 
made the aircraft bounce to the left of runway centerline. 
 The absence of immediate go around initiation after the first bounce resulted in the aircraft 
made second touched down on the left shoulder of the runway.
The KNKT acknowledged the safety actions taken by the Garuda Indonesia and considered 
relevant to address the safety issue identified in this report. However, there were safety issue 
remains to be considered. Therefore, the KNKT issues safety recommendations to the Garuda 
Indonesia to address safety issues identified in this report.

At 0537 UTC, the SIC advised to the Ende Aeronautic Communication Officer (ACO) that the aircraft was turning on final runway 27. The ACO responded that the wind direction was 150° with velocity of 18 knots and advised that the runway was clear. On short final, the SIC checked the wind shock located on the right side of beginning runway and was coherent to the information of the wind condition from the ACO. During the second bounce, the master warning light illuminated consisted with the “Pitch Disconnect” warning on the Engine and WarningDisplay (EWD). The flight crew applied significant dual and opposite control columns inputs (leading to pitch uncoupling mechanism activation) - pitch down by the PIC on left seat and pitch up by the SIC on right seat (pitch up authority is higher). The investigation concluded the contributing factors of the occurrence as follows: Continuation of unstabilized approach with too much speed and nose down attitude resulted in the nose wheel touched the runway first, and with the roll about 3° to the left made the aircraft bounce to the left of runway centerline.  The absence of immediate go around initiation after the first bounce resulted in the aircraft made second touched down on the left shoulder of the runway. The KNKT acknowledged the safety actions taken by the Garuda Indonesia and considered relevant to address the safety issue identified in this report"

Eurocopter (Airbus Helicopter) EC130 B4 helicopter, registration PK-BKA was being 
operated by PT. Penerbangan Angkasa Semesta (PT. PAS) on 11 October 2015 as 
unscheduled chartered flight. The flight was planned from Kualanamu International Airport
(Kualanamu) – Siparmahan and return. The helicopter departed Siparmahan at 1133 LT, on 
board in this flight were five persons consisted of one pilot, one engineer, and three 
passengers which were from the charterer agency.
During the flight the helicopter entered a condition and the visibility decreased significantly 
that might result in spatial disorientation to the pilot.
The helicopter impacted to the water, all occupants evacuated and floated used the seat 
cushions. On 13 October 2015 one survived passenger was rescued.
The investigation determines the contributing factors to this accident were:
 The pilot experienced of spatial disorientation during flying on low visibility resulted in 
the inability to determine aircraft attitude and position;
 Unavailability of individual flotation devices and un-inflated of aircraft flotation device
decreased the occupant survivability. 
The aircraft operator had performed several safety actions prior to the publishing of this 
investigation report.

Makassar (WAAA) with flight number MV 7503. The aircraft departed from Masamba at 
0625 UTC (1425 LT), cruised at altitude 8,000 feet and estimated time of arrival Makassar at 
0739 UTC. On board on this flight were 10 persons consist of two pilots, one company 
engineer and seven passengers (four adults, one child and two infants).
The flight from Masamba to Makassar was the 6th flight sector of the day and the weather on 
the previous flights were clear. During cruising, at approximately 22 Nm from Masamba, the
pilots decided to deviate the flight from the company VFR routes to fly direct to BARRU.
At 0651 UTC, the CVR stopped recording. The CVR did not record Enhanced Ground 
Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) aural caution and warning prior to the impact. The 
investigation could not determine the reason of the absence of the EGPWS aural warning.

Transmitter (ELT).
All occupants were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed by impact force and post 
impact fire.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to the accident: deviation from the 
company visual route without properly considering the elevated risks of cruising altitude 
lower than the highest terrain and instrument meteorological condition in addition with the
absence of the EGPWS warning resulted in the omission of avoidance actions.
PT. Aviastar Mandiri had been performed several safety actions following this occurrence.

Aviastar Mandiri on a scheduled passenger service flight from Masamba (WAFM) to Makassar (WAAA) with flight number MV 7503. The aircraft departed from Masamba at 0625 UTC (1425 LT), cruised at altitude 8,000 feet and estimated time of arrival Makassar at 0739 UTC. On board on this flight were 10 persons consist of two pilots, one company engineer and seven passengers (four adults, one child and two infants). During cruising, at approximately 22 Nm from Masamba, thepilots decided to deviate the flight from the company VFR routes to fly direct to BARRU. The CVR did not record Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) aural caution and warning prior to the impact. On 5 October 2015, the aircraft wreckage was found on top of Bajaja Mount, Dusun Gamaru, Desa Ulusalu, Kabupaten Luwu, South Sulawesi on the coordinate of 3° 25' 52. The investigation concluded the contributing factors to the accident: deviation from the company visual route without properly considering the elevated risks of cruising altitude lower than the highest terrain and instrument meteorological condition in addition with theabsence of the EGPWS warning resulted in the omission of avoidance actions"

Republic of Indonesia","On 28 August 2015 a Boeing 737-300 Freighter, registered PK-BBY was being operated by 
PT. Cardig Air on a scheduled cargo flight from Sentani Airport (WAJJ) Jayapura to Wamena 
Airport (WAVV) Papua, Indonesia.
At 1234 LT (0334 UTC), the aircraft departed to Wamena and on board the aircraft were two 
pilots, and 14,610 kg of cargo. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while 
the Second in Command (SIC) who was under line training acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). 
There was no reported or recorded aircraft system abnormality during the flight until the time 
of occurrence. 
When the aircraft approaching PASS VALLEY, the Wamena Tower controller provided 
information that the runway in use was runway 15 and the wind was 150°/18 knots, QNH was 
1,003 mbs and temperature was 23 °C.
At 0646 UTC, the aircraft was on final runway 15 and Wamena Tower controller issued
landing clearance with additional information of wind 150°/15 knots and QNH 1,003 mbs.
At 0647 UTC, the aircraft touched down about 35 meter before the beginning runway 15 with 
vertical acceleration of 3.68 G. The left main landing gear collapsed and the left engine 
contacted to the runway surface. The aircraft stopped at about 1,500 meters from runway 
threshold. 
No one was injured on this occurrence.
The analysis on this Final Report discussed the relevant issues resulting in the under-shooting 
and the landing gear damage involving a Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The investigation 
determined the contributing factor was the large thrust reduction during the windshear 
resulted in rapid descend and the aircraft touched down with 3.683 G then collapsed the 
landing gear that had strength degradation.
At the time of issuing this report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi had been 
informed of safety actions resulting from the PT. Cardig Air. While the KNKT acknowledges 
the safety actions taken by the Merpati Pilot School, there still remain safety issues that need 
to be considered.
As a result of this investigation, the KNKT issued safety recommendations to address safety 
issues identified in this report to the PT. Cardig Air, AirNav Indonesia, Wamena Airport and 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

Cardig Air on a scheduled cargo flight from Sentani Airport (WAJJ) Jayapura to Wamena Airport (WAVV) Papua, Indonesia. At 1234 LT (0334 UTC), the aircraft departed to Wamena and on board the aircraft were two pilots, and 14,610 kg of cargo. When the aircraft approaching PASS VALLEY, the Wamena Tower controller provided information that the runway in use was runway 15 and the wind was 150°/18 knots, QNH was 1,003 mbs and temperature was 23 °C. At 0646 UTC, the aircraft was on final runway 15 and Wamena Tower controller issuedlanding clearance with additional information of wind 150°/15 knots and QNH 1,003 mbs. The analysis on this Final Report discussed the relevant issues resulting in the under-shooting and the landing gear damage involving a Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The investigation determined the contributing factor was the large thrust reduction during the windshear resulted in rapid descend and the aircraft touched down with 3. While the KNKT acknowledges the safety actions taken by the Merpati Pilot School, there still remain safety issues that need to be considered"
27,28, ,KNKT.15.08.18.04,Airbus 330-200,22-Aug-15,Inflight from Melbourne to Jakarta,"On 22 August 2015, an Airbus 330-200 aircraft, registered PK-GPO, was being operated by 
PT. Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from Tullamarine International Airport, 
Melbourne, Australia to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta, Indonesia with flight 
number GIA 717. There were two pilots, 11 flight attendants and 187 passengers on board.
During cruise and after the flight attendants served lunch, one of the flight attendants put 
pieces of dry ice inside an empty mineral water bottle and loaded it into the refrigerator unit in 
the middle galley.
Approximately 3 minutes after the dry ice was inserted into the refrigeration unit, the unit 
door burst. The refrigeration unit door was thrown towards and injured one of the Flight 
Attendant (FA). 
The other FA made an announcement and found doctor and a paramedic to administered first 
aid to the injured FA. The doctor advised the PIC that the injured FA’s condition was stable,
the bleeding had stopped and it was safe to continue the flight to Jakarta.
The aircraft landed safely at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta. The injured FA 
was transferred to the airport health facility and thereafter to the hospital in town. The injured 
flight attendant was the only person injured in this occurrence.
The investigation concluded that the burst of the refrigeration unit door was due to a result of 
pressure build-up that exceeded the capacity of the safety relief valve due to dry ice being 
placed in the refrigeration unit compartment. The door burst resulted in serious injuries to the 
flight attendant.
PT. Garuda Indonesia has put in several safety actions following this occurence. Komite 
Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) considered that the safety actions were relevant 
to improve safety and prevent reoccurrence. Therefore, KNKT did not issue safety 
recommendation to PT. Garuda Indonesia.
KNKT issued one safety recommendation addressed to the Directorate General of Civil 
Aviation (DGCA).","['On 22 August 2015, an Airbus 330-200 aircraft, registered PK-GPO, was being operated by PT', 'Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from Tullamarine International

Republic of Indonesia","On 12 August 2015, a PAC-750XL aircraft, registered PK-KIG, was being operated by PT. 
Komala Indonesia on an unscheduled passenger flight from Wamena Airport (WAJW) Papua 
to Ninia airstrip, Yahukimo, Papua that was located on radial 127° from Wamena with 
distance approximately 26 Nm. On board the aircraft were one pilot, one engineer and 4 
passengers.
Video footage made by a passenger captured the cockpit situation and surrounding area
during the final approach. The video also recorded that during approach, at an altitude of 
approximately 6,500 feet, the airspeed indicators indicated zero and the aural stall warning 
activated. The aircraft then flew to the left side and parallel to the runway. Thereafter it 
climbed, turned left and impacted the ground about 200 meters south-west of the runway.
The engineer on board was fatally injured, one passenger has minor injuries and the other 
occupants, including the pilot, were seriously injured. 
The investigation determined the contributing factors to this accident were:
 Continuing the flight with both airspeed indicators unserviceable increased the 
complexity of the flight combined with high-risk aerodrome increased the pilot 
workload.
 The improper corrective action at the time of the aural stall warning activating on the 
final approach, and the aircraft flew to insufficient area for a safe maneuver.
 The unfamiliarity to the airstrip resulted in inappropriate subsequent escape maneuver 
and resulted in the aircraft stalling.
 The pilot was not provided with appropriate training and familiarization to fly into a 
high-risk airstrip.
Until the issuance of this final report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) 
had not been informed any safety action resulting from this accident.

South Sulawesi
Republic of Indonesia","On 2 June 2015, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, registration PK-GFA was being operated by 
PT. Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta Airport, 
Jakarta to Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as 
Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). 
The calculation of the required runway length for the estimated aircraft landing weight 
with flaps 30 configuration was approximately 2,100 meters. 
After evaluation of weather condition, the controller changed the runway in use from 
runway 03 to runway 13. During approach on Instrument Landing System (ILS) runway 
13, the crew noticed that on the east of the airport was cloudy, the end of runway 13 was 
raining and approximately 1/4 part of the runway was wet on the end of runway 13. 
At approximately 100 ft Above Ground Level (AGL), the PM informed the PF that refer to 
the data displayed on the Navigation Display (ND), the tail wind was up to 10 kts and cross 
wind 10 kts from the right side of aircraft. 
During landing flare, the thrust levers were closed however the aircraft floated.The Cockpit 
Voice Recorder (CVR) data revealed that the interval between Enhanced Ground 
Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) call ‘ten’ to touchdown was 16 seconds while the 
Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded that after passing 20 ft to touchdown was 13 
seconds. Floating for 13 seconds with the current speed it was calculated that the aircraft 
has travelled approximately 1,075 meters. The FDR and airport Closed-circuit Television 
(CCTV) recorded that the aircraft touched down after passing taxiway Charlie. 
The flight crew did not consider a go around as they aware that the takeoff area of the 
runway 13 was mountainous area and might jeopardized the flight. 
The aircraft stopped at the left side of the stopway with the nose landing gear and left main 
landing gear stuck at the mud while the right main landing gear remain on the stopway 
pavement. No one injured on this serious incident.","['On 2 June 2015, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, registration PK-GFA was being operated by PT', 'Garuda Indonesia on a scheduled passenger flight from

During approach on Instrument Landing System (ILS) runway 13, the crew noticed that on the east of the airport was cloudy, the end of runway 13 was raining and approximately 1/4 part of the runway was wet on the end of runway 13. At approximately 100 ft Above Ground Level (AGL), the PM informed the PF that refer to the data displayed on the Navigation Display (ND), the tail wind was up to 10 kts and cross wind 10 kts from the right side of aircraft. The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) data revealed that the interval between Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) call ‘ten’ to touchdown was 16 seconds while the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded that after passing 20 ft to touchdown was 13 seconds. The FDR and airport Closed-circuit Television (CCTV) recorded that the aircraft touched down after passing taxiway Charlie. The flight crew did not consider a go around as they aware that the takeoff area of the runway 13 was mountainous area and might jeopardized the flight"

Republic of Indonesia","On 29 May 2015, a liberty XL2 aircraft registered PK-LLA was being operated by 
Lombok Institute of Flight Technology (LIFT) on solo touch-and-go circuit
exercises1 at Selaparang Airport, Lombok2
(WADA) and the student pilot was the 
only person on board the aircraft.
Prior the flight, the student pilot was briefed by another student pilot who used the 
PK-LLA aircraft. The other student pilot advised experiencing hard landing however, 
the aircraft condition appeared remain normal. The other student pilot did not 
consider that the hard landing was occurrence that need to be reported. The student 
pilot then conducted preflight check of the aircraft condition and considered that the 
aircraft condition was normal included the nose landing gear.
About 1500 LT (0700 UTC3
), the aircraft departed runway 27 of Lombok with the 
fuel onboard sufficient for three hours flight time, the departure process until the 
third touch and go exercise was uneventful. During landing approach of the fourth 
touch and go, the student pilot used flaps 20° with speed about 75 knots. The aircraft 
touched down and continued rolling with the flaps still on 20°. When the speed was
about 40 knots, the student pilot felt the nose wheel impacted a patched-runway and 
bounced. The aircraft then touched down harder than usual, to recover the bounce, 
the student pilot increased the engine power and continued to go around. 
At 0740 UTC, the air traffic controller (controller) received information from 
aviation security officer that there was a detached nose wheel on the runway. After 
knowing that the detached nose wheel was from PK-LLA aircraft, the controller
informed the situation to the student pilot and instructed to make holding on left 
downwind runway 27. The controller also coordinated with other related units 
including Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) and LIFT representative.
At 0750 UTC, chief flight instructor of LIFT (flight instructor) came to tower and 
communicated with the student pilot to calm down the student pilot. The flight 
instructor instructed to perform a slow flight with flap 30° to minimized the aircraft 
speed and to perform low pass over runway 27 for landing gear observation. The 
student pilot performed low pass flying four times over runway 27.
Since the wind direction was from 090° until 120° with velocity of 8 to 10 knots, the 
flight instructor advised the controller to change the runway in use to runway 09 and 
was approved. The flight instructor then instructed the student pilot to exercise a low 
pass on runway 09. The student pilot performed low pass three times over runway 
09. The flight instructor briefed the student pilot of how to make landing approach in 
such condition and advised to switch off ignition, master switch, and fuel selector 
after landing.","['On 29 May 2015, a liberty XL2 aircraft registered PK-LLA was being operated by Lombok Institute of Flight Technology (LIFT) on solo touch-and-go circuitexercises1 at Selaparang

The flight instructor briefed the student pilot of how to make landing approach in such condition and advised to switch off ignition, master switch, and fuel selector after landing"
31,32,18-May,KNKT.15.03.08.04,Sikorsky S-76C+,21-Mar-15,"Delta Mahakam River, East Kalimantan Republic of Indonesia","A Sikorsky S-76C+ helicopter, registration PK-FUP was being operated by PT. Hevilift 
Aviation Indonesia, on 21 March 2015 in day light conducted unscheduled charter flight by 
PT. Total E & P Indonesia. The flight was planned from Sepinggan Airport, Balikpapan to 
Handil helipad than continued flying over Central Processing Unit (CPU) to conduct pipe line 
inspection and return to Sepinggan.
At 0118 UTC, the helicopter departed Sepinggan with destination Handil helipad. On board in 
this flight were eight occupants consisted of two pilots, one engineer, one flight operation 
officer (FOO) and four passengers. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) 
and Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 0136 UTC, the helicopter 
landed at Handil helipad and refueled up to approximately 1,600 lbs for the preparation to the 
pipe line inspection flight that was estimated would take 2 hours. The passenger doors on both 
sides of the cabin were removed to ease the inspection. 
At 0205 UTC, the helicopter departed from Handil helipad to CPU. On board this flight were 
seven occupants from Sepinggan consist of two pilots, one flight operation officer (FOO) and 
four passengers, while the engineer stayed at Handil.
After reached the cruising altitude of 1,000 feet the PIC handed over the control to the SIC. 
The SIC engaged the autopilot and flew maintain cruise altitude and speed of 95 knot. The 
weather was clear, wind condition was westerly at speed of 5 knots and visibility 
approximately 8 km. At position approximately 8 Nm from CPU the PIC asked the SIC to 
descend to 600 feet with the rate of 200 feet/minute. While passing 800 feet the helicopter 
attitude became un-commanded. The helicopter rolled to the left and pitch up then rolled to 
the right and pitch down. The SIC lowered the collective and reduced the helicopter speed 
with intention to recover the helicopter attitude with no success. The PIC took over the 
control to recover the helicopter until impacted the tree and crash into swamp. All the 
occupants were survived.
KNKT conducted several tests and research and concluded that the separation of rod end 
bearing from the push rod resulted to the helicopter enters un-commanded attitude.
The investigation determined the contributing factor was the helicopter un-commanded 
attitude caused by loosening of the jam nut on the forward rod end bearing which 
subsequently separated from the push rod, resulted in the un-commanded servo movement.
As result of these accidents FAA issued the Airworthiness Directive related to inspection of 
push rod.
KNKT was informed that safety action had been taken by the operator and considered 
relevant to the occurrence. However, as result of the investigation KNKT issued the 
recommendation to the operator and Sikorsky which is relevant to the safety issue.","['A Sikorsky S-76C+ helicopter, registration PK-FUP was being operated by PT', 'Hevilift Aviation Indonesia, on 21

Garuda Indonesia as a passenger schedule flight with flight number GA7040 from Ngurah 
Ray International Airport of Bali to Lombok International Airport of West Nusa Tenggara. 
The aircraft departed from Ngurah Ray Airport at 09:10 UTC. On board in this flight were 34 
persons cosisting of three pilots, two flights Attendances and 29 passengers. 
The Second in Command (SIC) who was under line training acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the 
Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the third pilot who occupied the 
cockpit observer seat was also a pilot under line training. 
At 0952 UTC, the aircraft touched down and bounced three times with left wing up and rolled 
to the right about 2°. The aircraft travelled out of the runway for about 180 meters and 
stopped at approximate 15 meters on the right side of the runway 13. 
After the aircraft stop, the pilot called several “mayday” to the Lombok Tower controller and 
requested for assistance. The pilot then shut off the engines by activation the engine fire 
handle. The flight attendant contacted the pilot and asked for passenger evacuation, the PIC 
instructed to evacuate the passenger via left door. 
The Lombok Tower controller pressed the crash bell and the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting 
(ARFF) team arrived few minutes later and assisted the passenger evacuation. No one injure 
on this occurrence. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factorsto this serious incidents are: 
1. Two transfer of control at critical altitude without clear statement might have made that 
pilots not aware who has the full control of the flight and jeopardize the flight when the 
pilot receive the control not fully aware to the condition of the flight. 
2. The handling of the aircraft after bounce was contrary to the wind condition, and the 
application of the right rudder and cross wind condition might have made the aircraft 
turned to the right. 
Prior to issue this draft final report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) 
has received a Notice to Flight Crew regarding to safety actions taken by the operator 
following this serious incident. 
Following the investigation of this serious incident, Komite Nasional Keselamatan 
Transportasi (KNKT) issued several safety recommendations addressed to PT. Garuda

The Second in Command (SIC) who was under line training acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the third pilot who occupied the cockpit observer seat was also a pilot under line training. The flight attendant contacted the pilot and asked for passenger evacuation, the PIC instructed to evacuate the passenger via left door. The Lombok Tower controller pressed the crash bell and the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) team arrived few minutes later and assisted the passenger evacuation. Two transfer of control at critical altitude without clear statement might have made that pilots not aware who has the full control of the flight and jeopardize the flight when the pilot receive the control not fully aware to the condition of the flight. Prior to issue this draft final report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) has received a Notice to Flight Crew regarding to safety actions taken by the operator following this serious incident. Following the investigation of this serious incident, Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) issued several safety recommendations addressed to PT"

On 28 December 2014 an Airbus A320-216 aircraft registered as PK-AXC was cruising at
32,000 feet on a flight from Juanda Airport, Surabaya, Indonesia to Changi Airport,
Singapore with total occupants of 162 persons. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot
Monitoring (PM) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF).
The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded that 4 master cautions activated following the
failure of the Rudder Travel Limiter which triggered Electronic Centralized Aircraft
Monitoring (ECAM) message of AUTO FLT RUD TRV LIM SYS. The crew performed the
ECAM procedure on the first three master caution activations. After the 4th master caution,
the FDR recorded different pilot action and the parameters showed similar signature to those
on 25 December 2014 when the FAC CBs were pulled on the ground. This pilot action
resulted on the 5th and 6th master caution activations which correspond respectively to
ECAM message of AUTO FLT FAC 1 FAULT and AUTO FLT FAC 1+2 FAULT
Following two FAC fault, the autopilot and auto-thrust disengaged and the flight control
reverted to Alternate Law which means the aircraft lost several protections available in
Normal Law. The aircraft entered an upset condition and the stall warning activated until the
end of recording.
Participating in the investigation of this accident were Australian ATSB, French BEA,
Singapore AAIB and MOT Malaysia as accredited representatives.","['SynopsisOn 28 December 2014 an Airbus A320-216 aircraft registered as PK-AXC was cruising at32,000 feet on a flight from Juanda

A S2R-T34 Thrush (Thrush 510) was being operated by PT. Elang Nusantara Air (ENA) on a 
positioning flight from Batu Ampar, South Kalimantan with intended final destination was 
Cendrawasih Airstrip, Papua. The first flight departed Batu Ampar on 30 November 2014. 
On 1 December 2014, the flight was cancelled due to weather condition. 
On 2 December 2014 the flight continued from Djalaluddin Airport, Gorontalo with intended 
destination Baabulah Airport of Ternate, North Maluku. The flight departed Gorontalo at 
2323 UTC (0723 LT) and was conducted under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) at altitude 7000 
feet. The flight time estimated to be 2 hours 24 minutes and fuel onboard was suitable for 4 
hours and 30 minutes flight time.
At 0138 UTC, the pilot contacted to Manado Approach controller informed that the flight 
was diverted to Sam Ratulangi Airport of Manado. The aircraft position was 62 Nm on radial 
136 from MNO VOR at 8500 feet altitude. 
At 0200 UTC (1000 LT), the Manado Approach controller asked the pilot the position was 
replied by the pilot that position was 17 Nm from MNO VOR.
At 0205 UTC (1005 LT), the Manado Approach controller called the pilot but there was no 
reply. The last position of the aircraft displayed on the Manado Approach controlled radar 
screen was at coordinate 01 20 55 N 125 07 37 E at approximately 2 miles from the nearest 
coast line.
Weather condition on the area of last contact at 0900 - 1100 LT, based on the satellite 
weather image indicated formations of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds. The satellite 
image indicated that between 0940 to 1010 LT showed rain with intensity moderate to heavy.
The occupants and the main aircraft wreckage were not recovered. Parts recovered were left 
main landing gear, nose and right main wheel tires, outboard part of left elevator and two 
bags. Investigation utilizes all relevant available information.
The contributing factors of this accident was the aircraft entered into unrecoverable condition 
that might caused by pilot disorientation when flying in Instrument Meteorological Condition 
(IMC).

35,36, ,KNKT.14.10.24.04,Boeing 737-300,24-Oct-14,Wamena Airport Republic of Indonesia,"On 24 October 2014 a Boeing 737-300 Freighter, registration PK-BBS operated by PT. 
Cardig Air was on scheduled cargo flight. At 03:34 UTC the aircraft departed from Sentani 
Airport (WAJJ) Jayapura to Wamena Airport (WAJW) Papua of Indonesia. 
On board in this flight were two pilots, and 14844 Kg of cargo. The Pilot in Command 
(PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot 
Monitoring (PM). There was no reported nor recorded that the aircraft had system 
abnormality during the flight until the time of the occurrence. 
At about 15 minutes prior to the occurrence, the weather reported was the wind calm, 
visibility 10 Km and rain insight in the vicinity of the airport. The runway 15 was in used 
and according to the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) there was no instrument 
approach procedure and all incoming and departure flights refers to the Visual Flight Rule. 
The aircraft was flown in the proper weight and balance margin and in the estimate landing 
weight of 51.114 kgs, and when approach for landing runway 15 the pilot had selected 
Flap 40° with Vref 133 Knots and auto-brake 3.
The pilot saw the runway was approximately at 700 ft AGL and Wamena Tower informed 
the pilot that cleared to land following an advice that there was no rain on the runway.
At 04.06:16 UTC the aircraft touched down and full reversed thrust was applied. During 
landing roll the pilot did not feel any deceleration and then the pilot applying the manual 
brake and keeping full reverse thrust. The aircraft stopped at the Runway End Safety Area 
(RESA).
The aircraft was taxied from the RESA to the apron by the pilot, and the inspections found 
that number 3 and 4 tires spotted, both engines fan blades and the left side of aircraft 
horizontal stabilizer damaged.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this occurrence was that the

Republic of Indonesia ","On 19 September 2014, a Cessna 172 aircraft registration PK-MSN was being operated by 
Merpati Pilot School (MPS). The aircraft performed a training solo flight from Trunojoyo 
Airport, Sumenep to Puteran Training Area and return to Trunojoyo for conducting touch and 
go flight.
There was no report of aircraft abnormalities during the flight in Puteran training area until 
the first touch and go. When conducting the second touch and go, just after airborne the 
Trunojoyo AFIS officer stated that the pilot declared Mayday and acknowledged by the 
Trunojoyo AFIS officer.
The Trunojoyo AFIS officer stated that while reporting emergency situation, the aircraft was 
approximately on altitude 400 feet and turned to the right. The right wing tip hit the ground 
first followed by the nose and fuselage. The aircraft crashed on paddy field at approximately 
500 meters from the end of runway 12. 
The student pilot was fatally injured and the aircraft was substantially damage.
The safety issues identified on this report were associated to the engine performance 
inspection and emergency landing training.
The investigation determined the contributing factors was the instantaneous and explosive 
burning of the fuel/air mixture had led to detonation and caused the engine ran in a degraded 
performance significantly. Such situation required a proper flying skill and judgment

When conducting the second touch and go, just after airborne the Trunojoyo AFIS officer stated that the pilot declared Mayday and acknowledged by the Trunojoyo AFIS officer. The Trunojoyo AFIS officer stated that while reporting emergency situation, the aircraft was approximately on altitude 400 feet and turned to the right. The investigation determined the contributing factors was the instantaneous and explosive burning of the fuel/air mixture had led to detonation and caused the engine ran in a degraded performance significantly. At the time of issuing this report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi had been informed of safety actions resulting from the Merpati Pilot School. As a result of this investigation, the KNKT issued safety recommendations to address safety issues identified in this report to the Merpati Pilot School and Directorate General of Civil Aviation"
37,38, ,KNKT.14.09.19.04,Grand Caravan C-208B,9-Sep-14,"Mulia Airport, Papua 
Republic of Indonesia","On 9 September 2014 an aircraft Cessna C208B, registration PK-RSC was being operated by 
PT Enggang Air Service for an unscheduled flight route from Sentani Airport to Mulia 
Airport, which conducted under Visual Flight Rule (VFR) and the Pilot in Command (PIC). 
The aircraft was airworthy and flown within the weight and balance envelope, and there was 
no abnormality on the systems and or others until the time of the occurrence. 
Before the aircraft join the initial approach pattern to Mulia the pilot was able to contact with 
Mulia AFIS and received information include that on the final and gap area which was about 
2 nm of runway 08 were clear and the wind was westerly 8 knots. 
The Mulia Airport was located at approximately 5,500 feet of elevation and 10% up slope 
runway which normally covered by clouds during the afternoon hours. 
According to the pilot interview, the approach crew briefing and the approach check list was 
performed prior to land on runway 08, no traffic on the ground and the runway was clear. The 
landing procedures were completed at about 6000 feet (approximate 500 feet Above Ground 
Level), and the aircraft aligned with the runway. 
The aircraft touched down within the touchdown point of runway 08, then bounced and 
floated. After second touchdown the aircraft started to veer to the left, the pilot recovered by 
the applying reverse thrust and brake, however the aircraft continued veered to the left. 
The aircraft stopped on the left side of the runway with left main and nose landing gear 
damaged and sunken into soft soil. 
The engine shutdown and the passengers disembark the aircraft normally. No persons injured 
in this occurrence. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident were; 
• The illusion of the runway condition resulted to the pilot misinterpret the situation and 
late to flare on touchdown and bounced. 
• The recovery action performed by the pilot resulted to the force that moved the aircraft 
further to the left and difficult to recover back to the runway centerline. 
At the time of issuing this draft final investigation report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan 
Transportasi (KNKT) has been informed of safety actions resulting from this occurrence. 
Includes in this final report, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations to address the 
safety issues identified in this final report to PT. Enggang Air Service to ensure that pilots 
performs correctly the standard call out and the implementation of COM Chapter 6 page 6-48, 
and to review the cornering landing technique and ensure that the pilots had well understand 
and sufficient skilled to this particular cornering technique. KNKT also recommended the 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to oversight the implementation of the 
recommendation addressed to PT. Enggang Air Service.

Airport Surabaya (WARR) planned to perform runway maintenance that would be conducted at 
night after the runway operation. 
On 11 June 2014, between 0100 to 0500 LT, The Angkasa Pura I Brach Office Surabaya started
the runway maintenance that was performed by another company and consisted of 10 personnel
and used tools including pneumatic compressor, jack hammer, chisel, high air pressure hose, 
asphalt mixer, small container for asphalt mixture, debris sweeper and other supporting 
equipment. 
At 0405 LT, the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighter (ARFF) personnel performed the ARFF and
the Airport Facility Readiness personnel conducted runway readiness check in conjunction with 
patrolling the airside used patrol car. At 0430 LT, they reported to Juanda Tower controller that 
the runway was clear from any hazard except the area near intersection N3 where the runway 
repair was still in progress. At 0450 LT, the airport maintenance team reported to Juanda Tower 
controller that the runway repair had finished and the runway maintenance team had left the 
runway. No runway inspection was performed after the runway repair finished.
At 0500 LT, the airport operation initiated. Between 0500 LT and 0606 LT, 11 aircraft departure 
and one arrival, no pilot reported the foreign object on the runway. The first pilot report of 
objects was near the intersection taxiway N5 and was made at 0609 LT which was after sunrise 
at 0559 LT. This indicated that the objects were not clearly visible during dark time.
At 0615 LT, the controller contacted the Airport Facility Readiness personnel but no reply,
thereafter the controller contacted the ARFF personnel informed the pilot report of object on the 
runway and requested to check the existence of the reported object. When the ARFF vehicle 
arrived near the runway the controller instructed to wait for three aircraft that were about to 
land.
At 0620 LT, an ATR 72-212A (600 version) registered PK-WGK with flight number IW1861 
landed and impacted chisel, resulted in eight holes on the aircraft lower fuselage.
At 0623 LT, the controller decided to close the runway operation and instructed the ARFF 
personnel to enter and inspect the runway. The ARFF personnel found compressor hose (about 
10 meters long), jack hammer (about 60 cm long) and chisel (about 4.5 kg) on the runway.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident were:
 The runway inspection that was performed while the runway maintenance has not been 
finished resulted in the object which were on dark colour and found on dark surface did not 
properly inspect, and
 The insufficient information regarding the objects and the location might have made
improper assessment to the consequences of the runway operation and delaying the object 
removal.

Adventist Aviation Indonesia as non-schedule flight from Doyo Baru Airstrip with 
intended destination of Ninia Airstrip, Papua. On board in this flight were 7 persons consist 
of one pilot and six passengers. 
This flight was the fourth flights for the pilot. The flight time to Ninia was estimated of 1 
hour and was planned at cruising altitude of 10,000 feet and the fuel on board were 
sufficient for 4 hours flight time. 
At 0024 UTC, the pilot received clearance for takeoff. 
At 0027 UTC, Sentani Tower controller has not received reports from the PK-SDF pilot 
and tried to call but was not responded. 
At 0030 UTC, The Chief Section of Sentani Tower Air Navigation obtained information 
that the aircraft had experienced an accident during takeoff at Doyo Baru. 
The aircraft failed to lift off and impacted to several objects prior to stop at 30 meters from 
the end of the runway. The nose section damage after consumed by post impact fire. 
Two occupants including the pilot were fatally injured and five other occupants seriously 
injured. All occupants were taken to Yowari Hospital (Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah – 
RSUD Yowari). 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this occurrence was due to the 
aircraft was not in the correct takeoff configuration which required wing flap 20° while the 
flap was found on position of 6° during impact. The investigation concluded that the flap 
was selected during the takeoff roll when the pilot realized that the aircraft did not airborn 
on the position where normally became airborne. The pilot also operated the Emergency 
Power Lever intended to add more engine power. The corrective actions to recover the 
situation by selection of emergency power lever and flap were not proper for particular 
condition. 
At the time of issuing this Final Report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi 
has been informed safety action of the Adventist Aviation Indonesia by installing a CCTV 
to monitor pilot and aircraft behavior on takeoff. 
As result of this investigation, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations to 
address the safety issues identified in this final report, which is related to flight operation 
procedures and airport firefighting equipment and system to the PT. Adventist Aviation 
Indonesia, Doyo Baru Airport authority and Directorate General of Civil Aviation.","['A Kodiak-100 aircraft, registered PK-SDF, on 9 April 2014 was being operated by PT', 'Adventist Aviation Indonesia

Republic of Indonesia","An ATR 72-500, registered PK-WFR, on 28 March 2014 was being operated by PT. Wings 
Abadi Air, as scheduled passenger flight. The aircraft departed Pomala Airport, Sulawesi 
Tenggara at 0710 UTC (1510 LT) to Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar, Sulawesi Selatan. 
On board in this flight were two pilots, two flight attendants and 73 passengers. The Second 
in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot 
Non Flying (PNF). 
The pilot elected to fly via MKS VOR to avoid cumulonimbus cloud on the south east area 
from Makassar. The flight then vectored for Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach 
runway 03. 
At 1500 feet, the Hasanuddin Tower controller and was provided the landing clearance with 
additional information of wind which was from 120° up to 23 knots. Refer to the information 
from the controller and considered the experience of the SIC, the PIC took over the control of 
the aircraft and the SIC performed the duty as PNF.
The PIC noticed that on the right side of the final course was dark and thick cloud, while on 
the left was clear. 
At 08.00 UTC, the aircraft touched down normal on the touchdown zone. The pilot started to 
applied the brake and reverse the propeller. The FDR recorded that after touchdown, left 
rudder was applied gradually from 3° up to 27° and the aircraft heading was varied between 
026° to 031°. The application of left rudder reduced and changed to right rudder up to 26° and 
the aircraft heading changed from 030° to 074°. The aircraft then run off to the right of the 
runway. The aircraft skid and veered to the right and stopped at 15 meters from the runway 
pavement. 
No one injured in this serious incident. The aircraft suffer minor damage mainly on the 
landing gear doors. 
The investigation concluded that the incorrect rudder application to compensate the crosswind 
affect had resulted in the aircraft exiting the runway. This might due to the pilot confusion to 
the crosswind effect as result of inadequate training.
At the time of issuing this final investigation report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan 
Transportasi (KNKT) has been informed safety action of the PT. Wings Abadi Air. 
Following this investigation, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to PT.Wings

The aircraft departed Pomala Airport, Sulawesi Tenggara at 0710 UTC (1510 LT) to Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar, Sulawesi Selatan. The pilot elected to fly via MKS VOR to avoid cumulonimbus cloud on the south east area from Makassar. At 1500 feet, the Hasanuddin Tower controller and was provided the landing clearance with additional information of wind which was from 120° up to 23 knots. Refer to the information from the controller and considered the experience of the SIC, the PIC took over the control of the aircraft and the SIC performed the duty as PNF. The PIC noticed that on the right side of the final course was dark and thick cloud, while on the left was clear. The FDR recorded that after touchdown, left rudder was applied gradually from 3° up to 27° and the aircraft heading was varied between 026° to 031°. The investigation concluded that the incorrect rudder application to compensate the crosswind affect had resulted in the aircraft exiting the runway.

Republic of Indonesia","On 8 March 2014 a Piper Warrior III aircraft registered PK-AEE was operated by Sekolah 
Tinggi Penerbangan Indonesia (STPI - Indonesia Civil Aviation Institute), was performing a 
mutual flight exercises over Nangun area at Cilacap. On board the aircraft were two student 
pilots a nd the pilot flying occupied the left control seat.
The aircraft departed Tunggul Wulung Airport at 0151 UTC, and after airborne at 1,500 ft the 
aircraft turned left proceed to Nangun area and maintain 2,500 ft. The weather at about 5 
minutes after the occurrence was meeting the criteria for visual flight with the wind direction 
from 300° at 6 kts.
After performing some exercises, the aircraft returned to Tunggul Wulung airport and the 
non-flying pilot requested to Tunggul Wulung controller to join the right downwind of 
runway 13 at 1,000 ft and intended to join right base. At short final, the pilot performed the 
approach with slightly above the glide due to an obstacle surround the area. According to the
pilot report, the pilot flew the aircraft at approach speed of 70 Kts when over the threshold, 
leveling the wings and close throttle. After the main wheels touched the runway and while the 
pilot expecting the nose wheel touching the runway, the propeller hit the ground and the nose 
landing gear collapsed.
The aircraft stop at 181 meters from the point of the main wheel touched the runway and 
approximate 35 meters before the aircraft stop there were several marks of propeller and the 
nose landing gear contacted the runway.
The analysis discussed the landing technique and the broken of the nose landing gear and 
concluded that:
- The aircraft landed in the normal landing technic and procedure.
- There was fatigue crack propagated from internal, but the crack could not be detected 
visually.
- This initial fatigue crack might be suspected from manufacturing pipe failure, and the 
failure will rarely occur.
As a result of this investigation, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi issued safety 
recommendations to address issues identified in this report and addressed to:
Sekolah Tinggi Penerbangan Indonesia (STPI) / Indonesia Civil Aviation Institute:
a. to ensure that all the nose gear sliding member of the similar aircraft to be inspected to
ensure that there was no fatigue crack.
b. to review the current inspection method to enable detecting specific crack that could 
not be detected visually.
Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA):
Consider to the recommendations address to STPI, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan 
Transportasi recommends the DGCA has to ensure that the aforesaid recommendations are 
well implement.

Manual considering the complexity of the occurrence, the final investigation report of this 
serious incident is using short report format. 
On 28 January 2014 a Cessna 172S registration PK-BOB operated by LOKA Pendidikan dan 
Pelatihan Penerbang was conducting solo area flight training. Prior to the occurrence the 
aircraft was airworthy and there was no abnormality reported and the weather reported met 
the criteria for visual flight.
After returning from the area, and during approach on short final runway 08 at approximately 
200 feet, the student pilot observed another aircraft on runway and decided to go rround, at 
the same time the Blimbingsari Tower controller issued landing clearance and the student 
pilot cancelled the decision to go around and elected to continue landing. 
During landing the aircraft bounced two times then student pilot performed go around and 
during climbing the student pilot heard unusual sound from the engine. On downwind, the 
student pilot felt difficulty in controlling the aircraft. The aircraft landed safely.
Observations on the runway found that there were two scratch marks at approximate 200 feet 
from the beginning runway 08. The aircraft examination found the nose wheel tire come out 
from the hub and both propeller blades tip bent.
The student pilot had total flying hours of 20 hours 32 minutes including 06 hours and 5 
minutes on type, the student pilot has been scheduled for 40 minutes flying in the 90 days
excluding the serious incident flight.
The investigation had concluded that the Contributing Factor was the decisions changed were 
made during most critical phase of the flight and occurred in short period of time was a 
difficult task considering the experience of the student pilot which resulted in improper 
handling and led to the steep nose down landing attitude.

Republic of Indonesia","YNOPSIS 
On 27 January 2014, a Boeing 737-300 registration PK-CKL was being operated by PT. 
Sriwijaya Air on schedule passenger flight from Sepinggan Airport, Balikpapan (BPN / 
WALL) to Juanda International Airport, Surabaya (SUB / WARR). The aircraft departed from 
Balikpapan at 0109 UTC. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) and 
the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF). 
Prior to the flight both pilots did not receive information of the current NOTAM (Notice to 
Airmen) for Juanda International Airport either from Balikpapan or Jakarta flight operation 
office. On the day of this serious incident, there was a NOTAM regarding to the status of 
taxiway SP2 that was closed due to work in progress of scrubbing, overlay and paving 
shoulder and was valid from 1 to 30 January 2014. 
The pilot conducted the VOR/DME approach for runway 28. During the interview the PM 
stated that the weather was hazy and at 600 feet, both pilots saw the darker and shinier object 
on the surrounding area which they assumed as the runway. The pilots flew toward the object 
and raised some question to the controller regarding to the several objects on the runway. 
The aircraft flew at low altitude below 50 feet over the taxiway SP2 up to touch down for 
approximately 29 seconds. 
There was hazard report from a pilot reported the possibility of mistaking taxiway for runway 
during conducting a VOR/DME approach runway 28, which was received 30 days before this 
occurrence. 
No one injured and no damage to the aircraft in this serious incident. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident were as 
follow; 
• The environment of the airport and the condition of the taxiway approach created an 
illusion that the SP2 taxiway appeared brighter than the active runway for pilot on the 
final approach. 
• The absence of the operator SOP related to the requirement for go around on uncertain 
condition and the NOTAM information which might became the short term memory 
have made the pilot elected to continue landing following uncertain condition prior to 
land. 
Prior to issue this final investigation report, the KNKT had been informed of safety actions 
resulting of the internal investigation by the operators concerning to operational safety related 
to this occurrence. 
Included in this final report, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations to PT. 
Sriwijaya Air, PT. Angkasa Pura I, Airnav Indonesia of Surabaya and Directorate General of 
Civil Aviation to address the safety issues identified in this final report.

On the day of this serious incident, there was a NOTAM regarding to the status of taxiway SP2 that was closed due to work in progress of scrubbing, overlay and paving shoulder and was valid from 1 to 30 January 2014. During the interview the PM stated that the weather was hazy and at 600 feet, both pilots saw the darker and shinier object on the surrounding area which they assumed as the runway. There was hazard report from a pilot reported the possibility of mistaking taxiway for runway during conducting a VOR/DME approach runway 28, which was received 30 days before this occurrence. The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident were as follow; • The environment of the airport and the condition of the taxiway approach created an illusion that the SP2 taxiway appeared brighter than the active runway for pilot on the final approach. • The absence of the operator SOP related to the requirement for go around on uncertain condition and the NOTAM information which might became the short term memory have made the pilot elected to continue landing following uncertain condition prior to land. Prior to issue this final investigation report, the KNKT had been informed of safety actions resulting of the internal investigation by the operators concerning to operational safety related to this occurrence"

Republic of Indonesia","On 19 January 2014, a PA-31-350 Piper Chieftain, registered PK-IWT, was being operated by 
PT. Intan Angkasa Air Service, on positioning flight from Sentani Airport, Jayapura with 
intended destination of Juanda Airport, Surabaya for aircraft maintenance. The positioning 
flight was planned to transit at Dumatubun Airport Langgur of Tual, Maluku and Haluoleo 
Airport, Kendari at South East Sulawesi for refuelling.
On the first sector, the aircraft departed Sentani Airport at 2351 UTC (0851 WIT) and 
estimated arrival at Langgur was 0320 UTC. On board on this flight was one pilot, two 
company engineers and one ground staff.
At 0240 UTC the pilot contacted to the Langgur FISO, reported that the aircraft position was 
85 Nm to Langgur Airport at altitude 10,000 feet and requested weather information. Langgur
FISO acknowledged and informed that the weather was rain and thunderstorm and the runway 
in used was 09.
When the aircraft passing 5,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Langgur FISO and reported that 
the aircraft position was 50 Nm from langgur and informed the estimated time of arrival was 
0320 UTC. The Langgur FISO acknowledged and advised the pilot to contact when the 
aircraft was at long final runway 09.
At 0318 UTC, the pilot contacted Langgur FISO, reported the position was 25 Nm to Langgur
at altitude of 2,500 feet and requested to use runway 27. The Langgur FISO advised the pilot 
to contact on final runway 27.
At 0325 UTC, Langgur FISO contacted the pilot with no reply.
At 0340 UTC, Langgur FISO received information from local people that the aircraft had 
crashed.
The aircraft was found at approximately 1.6 Nm north east of Langgur Airport at coordinate 
5° 38’ 30.40” S; 132° 45’ 21.57” E. All occupants fatally injured and the aircraft destroyed by 
impact force and post impact fire.
The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post impact fire, several parts of the 
remaining wreckage such as cockpit could not be examined due to the level of damage. The 
aircraft was not equipped with flight recorders and the communication between ATC and the 
pilot was not recorded. No eye witness saw the aircraft prior to impact. Information available 
for the investigation was limited. The analysis utilizes available information mainly on the 
wreckage information including the information of the wings, engines and propellers.
Based on the available evidences, the investigation concluded that the left engine failed 
during approach. The propeller did not set to feather resulted in significant asymmetric forces 
on the left and right side of the aircraft. The asymmetric forces created yaw and roll tendency 
and the aircraft became uncontrolled, subsequently led the aircraft to impact to the terrain.
Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) had not been informed any safety action 
taken by related parties. KNKT issue safety recommendations to address safety issues 
identified on this investigation to aircraft operator and Directorate General of Civil Aviation 
(DGCA).

Intan Angkasa Air Service, on positioning flight from Sentani Airport, Jayapura with intended destination of Juanda Airport, Surabaya for aircraft maintenance. The positioning flight was planned to transit at Dumatubun Airport Langgur of Tual, Maluku and Haluoleo Airport, Kendari at South East Sulawesi for refuelling. On the first sector, the aircraft departed Sentani Airport at 2351 UTC (0851 WIT) and estimated arrival at Langgur was 0320 UTC. At 0240 UTC the pilot contacted to the Langgur FISO, reported that the aircraft position was 85 Nm to Langgur Airport at altitude 10,000 feet and requested weather information. When the aircraft passing 5,000 feet, the pilot contacted the Langgur FISO and reported that the aircraft position was 50 Nm from langgur and informed the estimated time of arrival was 0320 UTC. At 0318 UTC, the pilot contacted Langgur FISO, reported the position was 25 Nm to Langgurat altitude of 2,500 feet and requested to use runway 27. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post impact fire, several parts of the remaining wreckage such as cockpit could not be examined due to the level of damage.

Tangerang
Republic of Indonesia","On 13 December 2013 an Airbus A330, registration PK-GPN operated by PT. Garuda 
Indonesia was on scheduled passenger flight from Ngurah Rai International Airport (WADD), 
Bali, to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (WIII), Tangerang, Indonesia. On board in this 
flight were two pilots, 11 flight attendants, 185 passengers. 
There was no reported or recorded that the aircraft had system abnormality during the flight 
from take-off until the time of the occurrence. 
The weather report for Soekarno-Hatta International Airport was broadcasted at 08.00 UTC 
and 08.45 UTC was moderate rain, thunder storm, wind direction was north-westerly and no 
significant weather were reported. 
At 124 ft, the autopilot was disengaged and the pilot resumed hand flying. Prior to touchdown 
after Flight Warning Computer (FWC) callout “TWENTY”, the SIC called “fly left” for two 
times, and followed by the FWC callout “RETARD” for tree times within three seconds. 
During the interview, the pilots explained that at about flare out altitude the aircraft entered a 
heavy rain impacted the left windshield and the PF loss of visual reference. The PF also felt 
that the aircraft floating. The PNF explained that he was able to see the runway all the time 
and observed that the aircraft was slightly on the right of the runway and advised the PF to fly 
left two times. 
At 08.00 UTC the aircraft touched down with the right main landing gear were on the right 
shoulder and travelled for 500 meters and returned to the runway then proceeded to taxiway 
S5. 
The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft system, therefore the 
analysis part of this final report focused on four safety issues, such as: course deviation prior 
to touchdown, approach and landing techniques, decision to land and meteorological 
concerning to the observing and reporting of visibility. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this serious incident were as the 
following factors: 
During the hand flying at approximately 90 feet AGL the aircraft started rolled in average 
of 2° to the right for approximately 12 seconds resulted to aircraft deviation to the right, 
whilst the PF loss the visual reference and prolong flare prior to touch down. 
• The above condition was an indication for go around which was not executed, this 
might cause by insufficient pilot intuitive decision to cope such condition. 
• The absence of no significant weather report might influence the pilot judgment and 
expectation of any weather change which may requires pilot decisions especially 
when occurs at low altitude. 
Following this serious incident, the VP Flight Operation of PT. Garuda Indonesia issued 
safety actions as shown in the appendix 6 of this final report. 
As result from the investigation Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi issued several 
safety recommendations addressed to PT. Garuda Indonesia, Badan Meteorologi Klimatologi 
dan Geofisika (BMKG), AirNav Indonesia and Directorate General of Civil Aviation.","['On 13 December 2013 an Airbus A330, registration PK-GPN operated by PT', 'Garuda Indonesia was on scheduled

Prior to touchdown after Flight Warning Computer (FWC) callout “TWENTY”, the SIC called “fly left” for two times, and followed by the FWC callout “RETARD” for tree times within three seconds. During the interview, the pilots explained that at about flare out altitude the aircraft entered a heavy rain impacted the left windshield and the PF loss of visual reference. The PNF explained that he was able to see the runway all the time and observed that the aircraft was slightly on the right of the runway and advised the PF to fly left two times. 00 UTC the aircraft touched down with the right main landing gear were on the right shoulder and travelled for 500 meters and returned to the runway then proceeded to taxiway S5. The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft system, therefore the analysis part of this final report focused on four safety issues, such as: course deviation prior to touchdown, approach and landing techniques, decision to land and meteorological concerning to the observing and reporting of visibility. The investigation concluded that the contributing factors to this serious incident were as the following factors: During the hand flying at approximately 90 feet AGL the aircraft started rolled in average of 2° to the right for approximately 12 seconds resulted to aircraft deviation to the right, whilst the PF loss the visual reference and prolong flare prior to touch down. • The absence of no significant weather report might influence the pilot judgment and expectation of any weather change which may requires pilot decisions especially when occurs at low altitude"

Boeing B 737-900ER (PK-LBH)",20-Nov-13,"Adisutjipto International Airport, Yogyakarta
Republic of Indonesia","On 20 November 2013, an Air Bus A320 operated by Indonesia Air Asia (IAA) was on 
schedule passenger flight from Adisutjipto Airport, Yogyakarta to Ngurah Rai Airport, 
Bali, with flight number AWQ 8411. 
At 00:36 the AWQ pilot requested taxi clearance and was cleared to taxi to holding point 
runway 27 via November Two (N2) by Adi Tower controller. The pilot reconfirm that the 
taxi way was N2 and requested to taxi via November Three (N3) taxiway. The Adi Tower 
controller reconfirm that the taxi way was N2 and continued by providing ATC clearance. 
The pilot tought that they were cleared to taxi to holding point runway 27 which was 
located on the taxiway N3, close to the runway 27 threshold. There was no other traffic 
communicated with Adi Tower controller. 
Prior the aircraft entered the runway the PIC shouted that there was an aircraft on final. 
Almost at the same time Adi Tower controller instructed to AWQ 8441 pilot to hold at 
present position. The PIC instinctively selected the throttles to reverse and applied brake to 
stop the aircraft and if possible moved backward. The aircraft stopped with the nose 
section 16 meters passed the yellow marking line of N2 taxiway on approximate heading 
170. 
A Boeing B737-900 operated by PT Batik Air on flight number ID 6360 was on regular 
passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta, Airport Jakarta to Adisutjipto Airport Yogyakarta 
and was under control Yogya Approach controller. 
The Yogya Approach controller advised to the pilot that runway was clear and gave 
clearance to land if the runway insight. 
The BTK pilot reported that the runway insight when the aircraft was on 3.5 miles to touch 
down. The Yogya Approach controller advised the pilot to contact Adi Tower controller 
after landing. 
After saw that the AWQ aircraft has entered the runway, while the BTK aircraft was 
approximately at 600 feet, the Adi Tower controller advised to the Yogya Approach 
controller to instruct BTK pilot to go around. The instruction was not passed to BTK pilot 
with consideration that the BTK aircraft was on short final and a go around might 
jeopardized the safety of the flight. 
The Adi Tower controller instructed BTK pilot to go around, however this instruction was 
not acknowledge by BTK pilots. 
Just after touched down, the BTK pilot saw that of the AWQ aircraft was on taxiway N2 
and the nose section had entered the runway. The BTK pilot then applied the maximum 
manual braking and full thrust reverse and the aircraft stopped at approximately 100 meters 
to the AWQ aircraft position. 
Refer to the calculation the required landing distance for medium braking action was 6,614 
feet or 2,016 meters and for good braking action was 4,813 feet or 1,467 meters. The 
vi 
landing distance of the BTK aircraft was approximately 1650 meters. The pilot action had 
avoided a collision between aircrafts. 
The investigation determined contributing factors involve in this occurrence were: 
• Misinterpretation between pilots and controller related to the position of holding point 
runway 27 and the taxi clearance had never been clearly clarified. 
• There was no transfer of control from Yogya Approach controller to Adi Tower 
controller and the landing clearance for the BTK flight was issued by Yogya Approach 
controller resulting to the initiative instruction from Adi Tower controller to BTK pilot 
to go around was not acknowledged by BTK pilots. 
During the investigation, the KNKT has been informed safety actions taken by Batik Air 
and Indonesia Air Asia that were considered relevant to improve of the particular 
condition. 
The KNKT issued several safety recommendations to address safety issues identified 
during the investigation to AirNav Indonesia and Directorate General of Civil Aviation 
(DGCA).

At 00:36 the AWQ pilot requested taxi clearance and was cleared to taxi to holding point runway 27 via November Two (N2) by Adi Tower controller. A Boeing B737-900 operated by PT Batik Air on flight number ID 6360 was on regular passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta, Airport Jakarta to Adisutjipto Airport Yogyakarta and was under control Yogya Approach controller. After saw that the AWQ aircraft has entered the runway, while the BTK aircraft was approximately at 600 feet, the Adi Tower controller advised to the Yogya Approach controller to instruct BTK pilot to go around. The BTK pilot then applied the maximum manual braking and full thrust reverse and the aircraft stopped at approximately 100 meters to the AWQ aircraft position. Refer to the calculation the required landing distance for medium braking action was 6,614 feet or 2,016 meters and for good braking action was 4,813 feet or 1,467 meters. The investigation determined contributing factors involve in this occurrence were: • Misinterpretation between pilots and controller related to the position of holding point runway 27 and the taxi clearance had never been clearly clarified. • There was no transfer of control from Yogya Approach controller to Adi Tower controller and the landing clearance for the BTK flight was issued by Yogya Approach controller resulting to the initiative instruction from Adi Tower controller to BTK pilot to go around was not acknowledged by BTK pilots. The KNKT issued several safety recommendations to address safety issues identified during the investigation to AirNav Indonesia and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)"

Republic of Indonesia","Based on the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) Policies and Procedures 
Manual, reporting for a serious incident can be published in short report format. However, 
the purpose of the investigation to determine the contributing factor and improve safety is 
maintained. 
On 14 November 2013 an aircraft Cessna C208B, registration PK-RSP was being operated 
by PT. Enggang Air Service with unscheduled flight route from Sentani Airport to Nalca 
Airstrip. 
The aircraft departed from Sentani at 2206 UTC to Nalca Airstrip which is about south of 
Sentani Airport for duration of 50 minutes flight time and cruised at flight altitude of 
10,000 feet. in this flight, the pilot was conducting a Visual Flight Rule (VFR). As from 
the interview with the pilot, he stated that this flight was the first flight experience from 
Sentani to Nalca airstrip. 
There were 10 person on board which was consisting of one pilot and nine passengers. 
The weather en route to and over the Nalca airstrip was fine and the wind was calm. There 
were no any abnormalities and or recorded during the flight.The pilot flew the aircraft to 
overhead the airstrip for observing the runway then to join the downwind of runway 24. 
At 22:56 the aircraft touched down runway 24 at landing speed about 78 knots and slightly 
on the right of the center line. At approximately 20 meters before the parking area which 
was on the right side of the runway, the right main wheel trapped and stopped with right 
wing slightly down and right wheel concealed in the ground in about one meter. 
After the aircraft stopped the pilot shutdown the engine in normal procedure, and helped 
the passengers to disembark the aircraft from left side of aircraft. No persons injured. 
The aircraft evacuated from the runway and placed at west and safe area out of the air strip. 
The investigation concluded that the absence of airstrip information had made the pilot not 
aware of the runway surface condition that might due to improper of risk management in 
seeking the risk to identify, analyze, assess and control the risks.

On 14 November 2013 an aircraft Cessna C208B, registration PK-RSP was being operated by PT. The aircraft departed from Sentani at 2206 UTC to Nalca Airstrip which is about south of Sentani Airport for duration of 50 minutes flight time and cruised at flight altitude of 10,000 feet. At 22:56 the aircraft touched down runway 24 at landing speed about 78 knots and slightly on the right of the center line. At approximately 20 meters before the parking area which was on the right side of the runway, the right main wheel trapped and stopped with right wing slightly down and right wheel concealed in the ground in about one meter. After the aircraft stopped the pilot shutdown the engine in normal procedure, and helped the passengers to disembark the aircraft from left side of aircraft. The investigation concluded that the absence of airstrip information had made the pilot not aware of the runway surface condition that might due to improper of risk management in seeking the risk to identify, analyze, assess and control the risks"

Batam, Riau Island 
Republic of Indonesia","On 12 September 2013 a Cessna 152 aircraft registered PK-KFC operated by PT Aviasi 
Solusi Prima (FlyBest Flight Academy) conducted a local flight training from Hang Nadim 
Airport, Batam. On board the aircraft were a student pilot who acted as Pilot Flying and a 
flight instructor who acted as Pilot Non Flying. 
There was no abnormality in the aircraft system since the taxied out and took off at 23:50 
UTC. During climbed to 1500 feet the student pilot increased the power and noted that the 
engine RPM was only 2,200 RPM, instead of 2500 RPM. Few moments later, while the 
aircraft altitude at 1,500 feet the engine power started to decrease to 2,000 RPM. The pilot 
requested to return to Hang Nadim Airport. Finally the oil pressure dropped to zero, and the 
engine was still running for about 15 second before stopped. The pilot performed emergency 
procedure and tried to restart the engine but unsuccessful then decided to make an emergency 
landing over the sea. The aircraft ditched on radial 158° and 8 Nm from BTM VOR. 
The instructor and the student pilot on board were minor injured and the aircraft up-side 
down and floated on the sea. 
The flying school was initiated on January 2013 and lean air mixture procedure was 
introduced. Since June 2013, the flying school changed the fuel type from AVGAS to 
MOGAS and the lean takeoff procedure was still applied. 
The maintenance record showed that the aircraft was grounded on 7 and 11 Sep’13 due to 
loss of power during the engine power check. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of the accident were as follow: 
1. The engine were overheating for some period of time (few days) as result of the 
combination of lean mixture in high engine power and the use of lower octane fuel 
which in the area of heavy detonation zone. 
2. The process of the change of AVGAS to MOGAS which was classified as alteration 
was not accordance with the CASR sub part 43.13. 
3. The discrepancies appeared after the use of MOGAS was unresolved within the 
management. 
Prior to issuing this final report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Tarsnportasi (KNKT) has 
been informed several safety actions taken by PT. Aviasi Solusi Prima (FlyBest Flight 
Academy) concerning to the leaning mixture procedure, inspections to the engines, fuel 
MOGAS test and hire an auditor specialist to ensure that the maintenance and alteration 
could be performed and recorded properly. 
As result of this investigation the KNKT issued several safety recommendations to PT. Aviasi 
Solusi Prima (FlyBest Flight Academy) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

Republic of Indonesia","On 6 August 2013, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft registered PK-LKH, was being operated by PT.
Lion Mentari Airlines (Lion Air) on a scheduled passenger flight as LNI 892. The aircraft
departed from Sultan Hasanuddin Airport (WAAA) Makassar, at 1203 UTC to Djalaluddin
Airport (WAMG) Gorontalo.
This previous flights were Soekarno Hatta Airport of Jakarta to Sultan Hasanudin Airport of
Makassar then Djalaludin Airport of Gorontalo.
During the flight to Gorontalo the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as the Pilot Flying (PF) and
the Second in Command (SIC) as the Pilot Monitoring (PM).
There were two pilots and five flight attendants with 110 passengers on board consisted of
104 adults, 1 child and 5 infants.
The flight from Makassar till commenced the approach to Gorontalo was un-eventful and
following with the weather was also clear.
At 1313 UTC, the aircraft touched down at runway 27 and during landing roll the flight crew
saw some animals ahead were crossing the runway. Then when approximate 550 meters from
the beginning of runway 27 and at aircraft speed approximate at 120 knots, the aircraft hit
such animals.
Afterward, the pilots felt ineffective of brake respond and then the aircraft veered off to the
left and trapped on the left side of the runway shoulder at about 2,100 meters from the
beginning of runway 27.
The smell of burning meat entered the cabin during the landing roll and went out after the
engines shut-down.
At 1314 UTC, the Djalaluddin Tower expressing a taxi clearance and it was not respond by
the pilots.
At 1315 UTC, the pilot informed the Djalaluddin Tower that the aircraft was hit animals and
stopped on the left runway shoulder and requested to check whether any fire on the aircraft
and also requested assistance from the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) to come at
site
The Djalaluddin Tower confirmed that there was no fire observed.
The PIC informed the situation to the passengers and requested to remain seated and wait for
further instruction. Some passengers evacuated the aircraft through right over wing
emergency window without any instruction from the flight crew.
Two passengers suffer sprained muscle around the ankle, as a consequence of evacuating the
aircraft through the emergency window without any instruction from the crews.
After the ARFF arrived and confirmed to the pilot that there was no fire on the aircraft.
The PIC decided to disembark the passenger via right forward and aft service doors using
rescuer stairs.
Afterward found there were two dead cows were found on the aircraft main landing gears.
Damage to Aircraft
vi
The aircraft hydraulic lines of the brake system and Weight on Wheel sensor were damage.
Personnel Information data showed that, the entire of flight crew had valid license and
medical certificate.
The aircraft was properly certified, equipped, and maintained in accordance with existing
Indonesia regulations.
The weather on this serious incident was fine with the horizontal visibility at 8km.
All communications between Djalaluddin Tower and the flight crew were recorded by ground
based automatic voice recording equipment and the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) for the
duration of the flight. The quality of the recorded transmissions was good.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors as follows:  Some fences at the north and south of the runway along about 500 meters were broken
and some parts were not installed with the fences.  The Djalaluddin Airport has been audited as the findings: some Airport perimeter fences
broken and the corrective action program did not perform. This condition it most likely
that, the wildlife hazard along the runway was extremely high since the last audit.
During the investigation the Djalaluddin Airport Authority had performed safety action as
mention on Chapter 4 (four), event the safety action had been performed the safety
recommendations issued to prevent the similar accident occur as a mention in the Chapter 5
(five).

The first pilot contact with Wamena Tower controller was at 2201 UTC, the aircraft position was approaching Pass Valley point, the controller informed the pilot toexpect runway 15 to be used and the weather condition was wind calm, visibility 4 Km and QNH 1008 mbs. At 2209 UTC, the pilot reported that the runway was insight and the controller provided the clearance to land and 25 seconds later the aircraft touched down on the centerline. During the landing roll at the aircraft veered to the left of the centerline, the pilot recovered by applying the right rudder and asymmetric reverses thrust but the aircraft continued veer to the left and stopped at about 10 meters on the left shoulder of the runway 15. The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident were as follow; The flight did not meet the criteria according to the recommended elements of stabilized approach which required go around. At the time of issuing this draft final investigation report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) has not been informed of safety actions resulting from this occurrence. Includes in this report, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations to address the safety issues identified in this final report to PT"
52,53, ,KNKT.13.05.13.04,Casa 212-200,10-May-13,"Sultan Babullah Airport; Ternate
Republic of Indonesia","On 10 May 2013, a CASA 212 -200 aircraft was being operated by PT. Nusantara Buana Air 
(PT. NBA) on a scheduled passenger flight as NBA 868. The aircraft departed from Sultan 
Babullah Airport, Ternate (TTE / WAMT) at 0455 UTC to Gebe Airport, North Maluku 
(GEB / WAMJ). The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in 
Command acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). 
This flight was the third flight of the day (TTE-MGL-TTE; TTE-GBE-TTE). The first and the 
second flights of the aircraft were operated normally. 
During climbing when the aircraft passed 6,000 feet, the left propeller detached from rear hub 
half. The pilots shut down the left engine by closing fuel shut of valve. The aircraft returned 
to Ternate and landed safely. 
No one injured in this accident. 
The propeller assembly inspection should be performed 300 hours or 300 cycle interval 
whichever reached first as stated on the Service Bulletin no, 61-1119. 
There was error on transferring data of flight cycle in the aircraft maintenance log up to 114 
cycles, and lead to exceeding of the next Non Destructive Inspection of the failure part by 155 
cycles, while the next NDI inspection based on flight hour was 30 hours remaining. 
The propeller log book did not contain flight cycle column and therefore the flight cycle was 
not recorded and may lead to the maintenance personnel interpreted that the inspection 
interval for propeller assembly was based on flight hour only. 
The investigation concluded that the factors of this accident were as follows: 
- The failure of the hub half was due to fatigue crack which was undetected as the Non 
Destructive Inspection has exceeded 154 cycles form the next schedule of inspection. 
- The exceeding of flight cycles was due to transfer error of data and miss-interpretation of 
inspection interval. 
- The recording column of the Propeller Log Book available in flight hour only, it may miss 
lead the interpretation of the maintenance personnel of the inspection interval based on 
flight hour only instead of both flight hour and flight cycle. 
During the course of investigation PT. Nusantara Buana Air has taken safety actions by 
performing the Non Destructive Inspection to all propellers installed on the CASA 212 -200 
fleets. 
The KNKT issued safety recommendation to address the identified safety deficiencies and to 
prevent the similar occurrence in the future to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and

The propeller assembly inspection should be performed 300 hours or 300 cycle interval whichever reached first as stated on the Service Bulletin no, 61-1119. There was error on transferring data of flight cycle in the aircraft maintenance log up to 114 cycles, and lead to exceeding of the next Non Destructive Inspection of the failure part by 155 cycles, while the next NDI inspection based on flight hour was 30 hours remaining. The propeller log book did not contain flight cycle column and therefore the flight cycle was not recorded and may lead to the maintenance personnel interpreted that the inspection interval for propeller assembly was based on flight hour only. The investigation concluded that the factors of this accident were as follows: - The failure of the hub half was due to fatigue crack which was undetected as the Non Destructive Inspection has exceeded 154 cycles form the next schedule of inspection. - The recording column of the Propeller Log Book available in flight hour only, it may miss lead the interpretation of the maintenance personnel of the inspection interval based on flight hour only instead of both flight hour and flight cycle. Nusantara Buana Air has taken safety actions by performing the Non Destructive Inspection to all propellers installed on the CASA 212 -200 fleets.

54,55, ,KNKT.13.04.09.04,Boeig 737-800,13-Apr-13,"Ngurah Rai International Airport, Bali Republic of Indonesia","On 13 April 2013, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft registered PK-LKS was being operated by
PT. Lion Mentari Airlines (Lion Air) on a scheduled passenger flight as LNI 904. The aircraft
departed from Husein Sastranegara International Airport (WICC) Bandung at 0545 UTC to
Ngurah Rai International Airport (WADD), Bali, Indonesia. There were two pilots and 5
flight attendants with 101 passengers on board consisted of 95 adults, 5 children and 1 infant.
The Second in Command (SIC) was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC)
was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight from the departure until the start of approach was
uneventful.
The aircraft followed the VOR DME runway 09 instrument approach procedure. The weather
while the aircraft was on final was raining.
At 0708 UTC, when the aircraft was at approximately 1,300 ft, the Ngurah Tower controller
saw the aircraft on final and gave a landing clearance with additional information that the
wind condition was 120° / 05 knots.
The significant information selected from the CVR, FDR and from the flight crew interview
of the circumstances during final approach was as follows:
At 0708:56 UTC, while the aircraft altitude was approximately 900 feet AGL the SIC
commented that the runway was not in sight whereas the PIC commented ""OK. Approach
light in sight, continue"". From the interview, the PIC stated that he saw flashing light at the
beginning of runway 09 which was also observed by the SIC later on. Both pilots stated that
the weather condition at that time was hazy and the PIC stated that he noticed that on the right
side of short final area was dark.
At aircraft altitude approximately 550 feet AGL, the PF disengaged the autopilot and the auto
throttle then continued to approach.
At 0709:47 UTC, the CVR recorded sound similar to rain hitting the windshield. The PIC
stated that the outside environment was ""totally dark"".
At 0709:53 UTC, while the aircraft altitude approximately 150 feet AGL the PIC took over
the control. The SIC handed the control to the PIC and stated that he could not see the
runway.
At 0710:01 UTC, after the EGPWS warning ""TWENTY"", the PIC commanded for go around.
At 0710:02 UTC, the aircraft impacted to the water.
The aircraft came to a stop facing north about 20 meters from the shore or approximately 300
meters south west of the runway 09 threshold.
The Ngurah Tower controller was informed by a pilot of an aircraft was holding on short
runway 09, that the aircraft that was on approach had crash into the sea near the beginning of
runway 09.
At 0711 UTC, the Ngurah Tower controller pressed the crash bell.
At 0713 UTC, the rescue team departed from the ARFF station and arrived at 0715 UTC. The
ARFF deployed 4 units foam tender, 1 unit ambulance and 2 units rescue tender.
At 0755 UTC, all aircraft occupants were completely evacuated, the injured passengers were taken to the nearest hospitals and uninjured occupants to the airport crisis centre. Four
passengers suffered serious injury and some others were minor or no injury.
The aircraft was substantially damaged and submerged into shallow water.
The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft and all systems were
operating normally.
Prior to issuing this final report, the KNKT has been informed several safety actions taken by
PT. Lion Mentari Airlines and Ngurah Rai ARFF.
The investigation concluded several factors to this accident are as follows:
An examination of the pitch angle versus engine power on the FDR data indicated that
the basic principle of jet aircraft flying was not adhered during manual flying.
The aircraft flight path became unstable below MDA when the rate of descend exceeding
1000 feet per minutes. This situation was not recognized by both pilots.
The PIC decision and execution to go-around was conducted at an altitude which was
insufficient for the go-around to be executed successfully.
The flight crew loss of situational awareness in regards of visual references once the aircraft
entered a rain cloud during the final approach below minimum descend altitude (MDA).
Included in this final report, the KNKT has issued several safety recommendations to the PT.
Lion Mentari Airlines, PT. Angkasa Pura I, Directorate General of Civil Aviation and Badan
Meteorologi Klimatologi dan Geofisika (BMKG) to address the safety issues identified in this
final report.
The investigation involved the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as
accredited representative.","['On 13 April 2013, a Boeing 737-800 aircraft registered PK-LKS was being operated byPT', 'Lion Mentari Airlines (Lion Air) on a scheduled passenger flight as LNI 904',

Both pilots stated thatthe weather condition at that time was hazy and the PIC stated that he noticed that on the rightside of short final area was dark. The aircraft came to a stop facing north about 20 meters from the shore or approximately 300meters south west of the runway 09 threshold. The Ngurah Tower controller was informed by a pilot of an aircraft was holding on shortrunway 09, that the aircraft that was on approach had crash into the sea near the beginning ofrunway 09. At 0755 UTC, all aircraft occupants were completely evacuated, the injured passengers were taken to the nearest hospitals and uninjured occupants to the airport crisis centre. The investigation concluded several factors to this accident are as follows:An examination of the pitch angle versus engine power on the FDR data indicated thatthe basic principle of jet aircraft flying was not adhered during manual flying. The flight crew loss of situational awareness in regards of visual references once the aircraftentered a rain cloud during the final approach below minimum descend altitude (MDA).

West Sumatera
Republic of Indonesia","On 27 March 2013 a Boeing 737-500 aircraft registered PK-CLJ operated by PT. Sriwijaya
Air was scheduled on a passenger services with flight number SJ 021 from Polonia Airport
Medan to Minangkabau International Airport (MKB/WIPT) then to Soekarno-Hatta
International Airport Jakarta (CGK/WIII). Prior to leave the hotel at Medan the PIC was explained that he had stomach ache and the
crew noticed that the PIC went to the toilet several times during the flight from Medan to
Minangkabau. On arrival from Medan to Padang during taxi to the parking position, witnesses reported
that the aircraft taxi speed was faster than other aircraft normally. The FDR recorded that
the aircraft taxi speed was 18 kts. The aircraft stop around 4 meters further than the
marking line with the left wing was near and almost hit the aerobridge. The marshaller
informed that he already gave stop signal, however the aircraft kept moving. The aircraft
then pushed back to the correct position and disembarking all passengers.
There was no hazard report made by the Sriwijaya Air staff or Minangkabau staff in
respect of this occurrence.
When approaching the threshold runway 15, prior to line up, the pilot turned the aircraft to
the left. The aircraft stopped on approximate heading of 270° with the nose wheel out of
the runway about 4.2m and in full deflection to the left.
On the runway was found 22 meters of rubber skid mark of the nose wheel beginning from
the center guide until aircraft stopped.
The FDR data revealed that during the initial turn for a line up on the runway 15, the
aircraft taxi speed was 21 knots.
There was no discrepancy reported of the aircraft and runway lighting system prior and
during the serious incident. At 1210 UTC all passengers and crew disembarked safely through the aft passenger door. The aircraft evacuated to airport main apron one day after the serious incident at 2100 UTC

Republic of Indonesia","On 5 February 2013, a De Havilland DHC 6-300 (Twin Otter) aircraft, registration PK-YRF 
was being operated under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) by PT. Trigana Air Service as charter 
cargo flight from Sentani International Airport (DJJ/WAJJ), Jayapura, Papua to Apalapsili 
aerodrome (AAS), Papua. 
The PIC has not been flown to Apalapsili for 2 years. Prior to the flight, the PIC collected 
information of the aerodrome and departed after received weather information that the weather 
over Apalapsili aerodrome was clear. 
The aircraft departed from Sentani at 0010 UTC and climbed to 8,000 feet on radial 220 JPA 
VOR. The persons on board were two pilots and one engineer, the Pilot in Command (PIC) 
acted as Pilot Flying and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring. 
At about 25 Nm from Apalapsili aerodrome, the aircraft started descentto 6,000 feet until 
approaching overhead, the pilots planned to land using runway 15, with intention to observe the 
runway conditions. Thereafter the aircraft descent to 4,500 feet flew overhead, and then join left 
downwind runway 15. 
The pilot decided to land with normal approach, the VREF speed (Reference Speed/ target 
threshold speed for landing) was 70 knots. 
At 0058 UTC, the aircraft touched down on runway 15, during landing roll the aircraft skid.The 
pilot pushed the right rudder pedal, brake, and engaged the right engine reverse followed by 
nose wheel steering to the right in order to recover the aircraft to the centre of runway. 
The aircraft stopped on the left of runway 15 about 500 meters from the beginning of runway 
15, the nose wheel and Left main wheels trapped on the drainage line. 
The marks on the runway found that the aircraft touched down on not align with the runway 
bearing the centre of the runway. The marks indicated that the aircraft constantly moved to the 
left as indicated by straight lines and did not parallel with the runway bearing. 
The marks also showed that the mark of the nose wheel was closer to the right wheel compare to 
the left on the last part of the aircraft movement. This indicated that the aircraft was faced to the 
right (skid) while the movement was constant. 
The PIC action to recover the situation by applying thrust reverser, brake and nose wheel 
steering were differed to the technique and statement in the AOM and worsening the condition. 
Prior to issuing this final report, the NTSC has been informed several safety actions taken by 
PT. Trigana Air Services as mention on the chapter 4 (four) on this report. 
According to factual information, findings and the contributing factors, the National

Trigana Air Service as charter cargo flight from Sentani International Airport (DJJ/WAJJ), Jayapura, Papua to Apalapsili aerodrome (AAS), Papua. At about 25 Nm from Apalapsili aerodrome, the aircraft started descentto 6,000 feet until approaching overhead, the pilots planned to land using runway 15, with intention to observe the runway conditions. The pilot pushed the right rudder pedal, brake, and engaged the right engine reverse followed by nose wheel steering to the right in order to recover the aircraft to the centre of runway. The aircraft stopped on the left of runway 15 about 500 meters from the beginning of runway 15, the nose wheel and Left main wheels trapped on the drainage line. The marks also showed that the mark of the nose wheel was closer to the right wheel compare to the left on the last part of the aircraft movement. The PIC action to recover the situation by applying thrust reverser, brake and nose wheel steering were differed to the technique and statement in the AOM and worsening the condition. According to factual information, findings and the contributing factors, the National Transportation Safety Committee issued several safety recommendations to PT Trigana Air Service and The Directorate General of Civil Aviation in this report as mention on the chapter 5 (five) on this report"
57,58, ,KNKT.13.01.01.04,Pilatus Porter PC-6,17-Jan-13,"Apalapsili Aerodrome, Papua
Republic of Indonesia","On 17 January 2013, a Pilatus Porter PC-6/B2-H4 aircraft, registered PK-UCJ, was being
operated by Yayasan Jasa Aviasi Indonesia (YAJASI) has experience landing excursion. The
aircraft operation was as a non-schedule cargo flight.
The aircraft departed from Sentani Airport, Jayapura, Papua to Wamena Airport, Wamena,
Papua at 06:54 LT (21:54 UTC on 16 January 2013).
The person onboard were two pilots; on the left side pilot under training as a pilot flying act
as second in command (SIC) and on the right side as an instructor and pilot monitoring act as
Pilot in Command (PIC).
During flight from Sentani to Wamena, the aircraft was normal, no indication of any
malfunction.
The Wamena weather on was VMC, wind calm, runway slippery due to water and rubber
deposit contaminated; the raining was stopped 20 minutes before the occurrence.
The aircraft was touchdown on runway 15 at 0801 LT (23:01 on the canter line, and then the
pilot flying applied reverse. During reverse, the aircraft veer off to the right and the pilot
flying tried to recover by pushing left rudder followed by the application left brake, but no
response and the aircraft continues veer to the right.
Just before out of the runway the SIC apply full reverse, the PIC instructed to add the power
aimed to make the rudder effectiveness and then took over the controls. The PIC adds the
power control lever forward try to straight the aircraft.
At approximately 157 meters from first touchdown the aircraft was out of right runway and
continue rolling over the runway shoulder, approximate 15 meters parallel to the runway.
The aircraft hit taxiway marking Alpha, caused the horizontal stabilizer, left wing tip and left
aileron detached from the wing. The aircraft become airborne again at a distance if 315 meters
from touchdown and continues rolling until approximately 408 meters from the first
touchdown the aircraft entered the runway again, and then the aircraft taxied to the Yajasi
apron and parked.
No person on board injured and the aircraft had major damaged.
The analysis part of this report discussed all the relevant issues related to aircraft veer off to
the right of runway. Because of the aircraft was not equipped with a Flight Data Recorder or
Cockpit Voice Recorder hence, the method of investigation used the combination of related
assumptions and associate aerodynamic theories.","['On 17 January 2013, a Pilatus Porter PC-6/B2-H4 aircraft, registered PK-UCJ, was beingoperated by Yayasan Jasa Aviasi Indonesia (YAJASI) has

The person onboard were two pilots; on the left side pilot under training as a pilot flying actas second in command (SIC) and on the right side as an instructor and pilot monitoring act asPilot in Command (PIC). The Wamena weather on was VMC, wind calm, runway slippery due to water and rubberdeposit contaminated; the raining was stopped 20 minutes before the occurrence. During reverse, the aircraft veer off to the right and the pilotflying tried to recover by pushing left rudder followed by the application left brake, but noresponse and the aircraft continues veer to the right. Just before out of the runway the SIC apply full reverse, the PIC instructed to add the poweraimed to make the rudder effectiveness and then took over the controls. The aircraft become airborne again at a distance if 315 metersfrom touchdown and continues rolling until approximately 408 meters from the firsttouchdown the aircraft entered the runway again, and then the aircraft taxied to the Yajasiapron and parked. Because of the aircraft was not equipped with a Flight Data Recorder orCockpit Voice Recorder hence, the method of investigation used the combination of relatedassumptions and associate aerodynamic theories"

Pontianak, West Kalimantan
Republic of Indonesia","On 19 October 2012 a Boeing 737-400 aircraft registered PK-CKN on flight number SJ182, 
was being operated by PT. Sriwijaya Air, as a schedule passenger flight from Soekarno-Hatta 
International Airport (WIII), Jakarta to Supadio International Airport (WIOO), Pontianak. 
At 0735 UTC, the aircraft was pushed back at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, on board 
the flight was 166 persons consisted of two pilots, four flight attendants, 160 passengers. 
Based on interview, the pilots stated that while en-route they received the weather information 
from Air Traffic Controller which informing that current weather at Supadio Airport was 
raining and thunderstorm with the horizontal visibility 6 km. 
The flight was vectored by Pontianak Approach to join the ILS runway 15 than contact to 
Supadio Tower when established localizer. 
At 800 ft the pilot called Supadio Tower, that they could see the runway and then Supadio 
Tower replied by giving a landing clearance. 
At 50 ft, the FDR recorded that the tail wind component was 10 knot and the aircraft speed 13 
kts higher than the Target Vref. The aircraft stopped with the main wheels at about 2 meters 
from the end of stop-way runway 15 and the nose wheels sunk into the soft surface. 
The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft and all systems related 
to this occurrence. Therefore the discussion focused on the issues of: landing distance 
calculation, approach preparation and hydroplaning. 
The investigation concluded that contributing factors was the absence of approach briefing 
particularly on reviewing of landing distance might have decreased the pilot’s awareness 
toward better flight justification. This condition affected to the pilot justification which 
resulting the approach speed was 13 kts above Vref when the aircraft at 50 ft. And this 
particular condition was classified as un-stabilized approach and requires the pilot to go 
around. 
Prior to issue this final investigation report, the KNKT had been informed of safety actions 
resulting of the internal investigation by the operators concerning to the operational safety 
related to this occurrence. 
Included in this final report, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations to PT. 
Sriwijaya Air, Supadio Airport Authority, Pontianak and Directorate General of Civil 
Aviation to address the safety issues identified in this final report.","['On 19 October 2012 a Boeing 737-400 aircraft registered PK-CKN on flight number SJ182, was being operated by PT', 'Sriwijaya

At 0735 UTC, the aircraft was pushed back at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, on board the flight was 166 persons consisted of two pilots, four flight attendants, 160 passengers. Based on interview, the pilots stated that while en-route they received the weather information from Air Traffic Controller which informing that current weather at Supadio Airport was raining and thunderstorm with the horizontal visibility 6 km. At 50 ft, the FDR recorded that the tail wind component was 10 knot and the aircraft speed 13 kts higher than the Target Vref. The investigation concluded that contributing factors was the absence of approach briefing particularly on reviewing of landing distance might have decreased the pilot’s awareness toward better flight justification. Prior to issue this final investigation report, the KNKT had been informed of safety actions resulting of the internal investigation by the operators concerning to the operational safety related to this occurrence. Sriwijaya Air, Supadio Airport Authority, Pontianak and Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address the safety issues identified in this final report"
59,60, ,KNKT.12.10.21.04,Boeing 737-300,13-Oct-12,"Tabing Airfield, Padang, West Sumatra 
Republic of Indonesia","On 13 October 2012, a Boeing 737-300 aircraft was being operated by Sriwijaya Air 
conducted a scheduled passenger flight from Polonia International Airport, Medan (WIMM) 
to Minangkabau International Airport (WIPT), Padang. 
The aircraft departed Polonia International Airport with flight number SJY 021, on board the 
aircraft were 102 persons consisted of two pilots, four flight attendants and 96 passengers. 
The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) 
acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight was the first flight on that day.
The flight from departure until commencing for approach was un-eventful and mostly was on 
Instrument Meteorological Condition (IMC). 
Considering to the cloud condition, the pilot requested runway 33 for the Instrument Landing 
System (ILS) approach and it was approved by the Minang Approach. On descend the pilots 
conducted approach briefing for ILS approach runway 33 according to the Instrument 
Approach Procedure (IAP) chart. The pilots stated that the information contained in the 
approach chart of “Tabbing (can be mistaken for Minangkabau Intl)” was absent during the 
briefing.
When the flight had established to the localizer, the PIC saw a runway at approximately 10° 
on the right, the pilot then reported to Minang Approach that the runway was in sight and was 
instructed to contact Minangkabau Tower controller. The pilot intended to make a visual 
approach and disconnected the autopilot then flew manually toward that runway. When 
conducting the visual approach, the pilot assumed that the localizer was incorrect as the 
runway was on the right side. The pilot continued the approach with landing gear down and 
flap 40. The PIC also realized that the rate of descent was about 1,700 feet per minute.
After landing, the pilot reported to Minang tower that they had landed at Tabing Airfield. The 
passengers were completely disembarked safely.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors to this accident are the unclear 
significant information in the photocopy of the ILS approach chart might have missed by the 
pilot and might reduce the pilot awareness to the adjacent airport with similar runway 
direction and dimension; the previous experience of false VOR might have made the approach 
was continued in an un-stabilized approach condition, and the information of incorrect 
runway was not provided during the abnormal approach as it was not observed.
Following this accident the aircraft operator has issued six safety actions and the airport 
operator has issued two safety actions which considered relevant to improve safety. In 
addition, KNKT issued safety recommendations addressed to aircraft operator, air navigation 
provider and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.","['On 13 October 2012, a Boeing 737-300 aircraft was being operated by Sriwijaya Air conducted a scheduled passenger flight from Polonia

Republic of Indonesia","The investigation could not reach the accident site due to terrain condition, therefore the
investigation utilized photos of the wreckage and other relevant and data, which were taken 
by the search and rescue personnel.
According to the KNKT policy and procedures, investigation report of accident with fatality 
should be in full report format. However, to minimize subheadings without information, this 
investigation reported in short report format.
On 03 October 2012, a Pacific Aerospace LTD, PAC 750 XL aircraft registration PK-RWT 
was being operated by Yayasan Pelayan Penerbangan Tariku Aviation on a flight from 
Koropun to Dekai in Papua area. This flight was the 9
th flight of that day. All flights were 
performed in accordance to the Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
The first flight was from Sentani to Langda which was arrived at 2220 UTC (0720 LT). The 
last contact of the pilot was “the aircraft on the ground Koropun” at 0120 UTC as reported by 
the pilot through the company flight following system. The aircraft then departed Koropun to 
Dekai and lost contact during this flight. On board in this flight were one pilot and one 
passenger. 
The aircraft was found on 5 October 2012, in mountainous area with approximate elevation of 
7,000 feet, at coordinate 0452’S; 13929’E. Both crew and passenger on board were fatally 
injured.
The pilot held valid license and medical certificate. All mandatory trainings and checks have 
been performed. The duty and rest period for the pilot were in accordance with the current 
Indonesia regulations. 
There was no damage or any system problem reported and the aircraft was airworthy prior to 
the departure.
This aircraft was not required to be equipped with any recorders according to the current 
Indonesia regulations. 
The examination to the aircraft wreckage indicated that this accident was classified as 
Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) where an aircraft, under control of the pilot, 
unintentionally impact to terrain. The CFIT accident commonly occurred when pilot vision to 
the terrain is blocked or in low visibility.
The investigation concluded the contributing factors as follows: The accident was classified 
as Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) which most likely occurred in low visibility 
classified as IMC (Instrument Meteorology Condition) while the flight should be performed 
in Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
Prior to issuing this final report, the KNKT has not been informed several safety actions taken 
by PT. Yayasan Pelayan Penerbangan Tariku Aviation.
Included in this final report, the KNKT has issued several safety recommendations to the PT. 
Yayasan Pelayan Penerbangan Tariku Aviation, and Directorate General of Civil to address 
the safety issues identified on chapter 5 (five) in this report.","['The investigation could not reach the accident site due to terrain condition, therefore theinvestigation utilized photos of the

However, to minimize subheadings without information, this investigation reported in short report format. On 03 October 2012, a Pacific Aerospace LTD, PAC 750 XL aircraft registration PK-RWT was being operated by Yayasan Pelayan Penerbangan Tariku Aviation on a flight from Koropun to Dekai in Papua area. The last contact of the pilot was “the aircraft on the ground Koropun” at 0120 UTC as reported by the pilot through the company flight following system. The aircraft was found on 5 October 2012, in mountainous area with approximate elevation of 7,000 feet, at coordinate 0452’S; 13929’E. The examination to the aircraft wreckage indicated that this accident was classified as Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) where an aircraft, under control of the pilot, unintentionally impact to terrain. The investigation concluded the contributing factors as follows: The accident was classified as Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) which most likely occurred in low visibility classified as IMC (Instrument Meteorology Condition) while the flight should be performed in Visual Flight Rules (VFR). Prior to issuing this final report, the KNKT has not been informed several safety actions taken by PT. Yayasan Pelayan Penerbangan Tariku Aviation, and Directorate General of Civil to address the safety issues identified on chapter 5 (five) in this report"

Super Air for an agriculture operation departed from Ujung tanjung Airstrip to Nagamas 
Airstrip the aircraft airborne at 0005 UTC (0705 LT) the weather information on 
destination was a bit haze. 
During flight to Nagamas Airstrip the weather was low cloud along the route. When the 
aircraft overhead Nagamas Airstrip, the runway was not in sight then the pilot decided to 
return to Ujung Tanjung Airstrip. Upon overhead Ujung Tanjung Airstrip the Pilot 
observed wind condition from the wind shock approximately 7 knots up to 10 knots from 
the South East, and He also observed there were motorcycles moving on the runway edge. 
As such condition categorized as normal operation he decided to land. 
During landing the aircraft experiences a hard landing and bounced, thereafter during 
rolling the aircraft veered off to the left and stopped on the ditch at approximately 21 
meters left of the runway edge beneath the palm trees with the tail upside. 
The right landing gear was sifted up and rearward, the propeller blades bent rearward and 
the outer upper right wing was heavy dent. 
The pilot certified and qualified according to Indonesia current regulation. 
The aircraft were certified and airworthy according to Indonesia current regulation. 
The runway surface of Ujung Tanjung airstrip was grass and slippery when wet, at about 
half of the runway there was a free access crossing road had a joggle that more than five 
centimeters, there was also free access road along the runway edge. 
The investigation could not find the hazard identification and risk assessment that 
mandated in the Sinar Mas Super Air AOM. There was no person injured in this 
occurrence. 
At about a half of the runway there was an access crossing road that had the grass missed 
and slippery when wet. 
The aircraft had experienced hard landing and veered to the left hit the ditch, the right main 
landing gear was collapsed, the propeller blades was bent and the engine flange C was 
wrinkle. 
The investigation concluded the contributing factors as follows: 
• The pilot departed without proper weather information and it sources, the weather en route was low cloud. 
• The pilot workload was increase due to fly in marginal weather combined with 
potential hazard near the runway.

Upon overhead Ujung Tanjung Airstrip the Pilot observed wind condition from the wind shock approximately 7 knots up to 10 knots from the South East, and He also observed there were motorcycles moving on the runway edge. During landing the aircraft experiences a hard landing and bounced, thereafter during rolling the aircraft veered off to the left and stopped on the ditch at approximately 21 meters left of the runway edge beneath the palm trees with the tail upside. The runway surface of Ujung Tanjung airstrip was grass and slippery when wet, at about half of the runway there was a free access crossing road had a joggle that more than five centimeters, there was also free access road along the runway edge. The investigation could not find the hazard identification and risk assessment that mandated in the Sinar Mas Super Air AOM. The aircraft had experienced hard landing and veered to the left hit the ditch, the right main landing gear was collapsed, the propeller blades was bent and the engine flange C was wrinkle. The investigation concluded the contributing factors as follows: • The pilot departed without proper weather information and it sources, the weather en route was low cloud. According to factual information, findings and the contributing factors in this final report, the NTSC has issued several safety recommendations to the PT"

East Kalimantan 
Republic of Indonesia","On 24 August 2012, a Piper Chieftain PA-31-350 aircraft, registered PK-IWH, was being 
operated by PT. Intan Angkasa Airservice to conduct an aerial survey (aero magnetic) flight at 
a survey area located north of Bontang, East Kalimantan. 
There were 4 persons on board; one pilot, one security officer and two surveyors. The flight 
was planned with an altitude of 3,000 feet AMSL en-route and 500 feet AGL while surveying 
the area. The fuel endurance was for 6 hours flight time. 
The aircraft departed from Temindung Airport (WALS), Samarinda at 0751 local time (LT - 
2351 UTC). 
At 0004 UTC, the pilot informed to the Temindung Control Tower controller (Temindung 
Tower) that the aircraft was abeam Tanjung Santan descending from 3,000 feet and 
established contact with Bontang Info officer (Bontang Info). 
At 0005 UTC, the pilot informed the Bontang Info that their altitude was 300 feet and 
estimated over Bontang at 0011 UTC. Bontang info acknowledged this transmission and 
advised the pilot to report when the flight left the Bontang Area. 
At 0010 UTC, the SureTrack (flight following system) stopped receiving data from the 
aircraft. The last recorded information was an aircraft speed of 138 knots, heading 352°, 
latitude 0°8’33” N and longitude 117°12’54” E. 
At 0600 UTC, the engineer of the PK-IWH aircraft asked the Temindung Tower about the 
flight as the fuel endurance had been exceeded. 
The Temindung Tower contacted Bontang Info to get information about the aircraft. After 
receiving the request, Bontang Info tried to contact the pilot twice and there was no reply. 
Bontang Info also contacted the Tanjung Bara Airstrip to request information about the 
aircraft but there was no information. 
At 0730 UTC, the search and rescue team assembled, the team consisted of the Temindung 
Airport Authority, National Search and Rescue, Indonesian Police, Army and Airforce. The 
search operation was conducted via ground and air using three helicopters. 
On 26 August 2012 at 0850 UTC, the aircraft wreckage was located by a ground search team 
on a ridge of Mayang Hill, Bontang at approximately 1,200 feet AMSL at coordinates 
00°12’34.3”N, 117°16’57.3”E, 12 NM from Bontang Aerodrome on bearing of 294°. The 
accident site was within the planned aircraft survey area. 
All occupants were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed by impact force and post 
impact fire. 
The investigation found several findings and concluded that this accident is typical of a 
Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). Low altitude flying in a low visibility environment 
limited the pilot’s sight and increases the probability impact to the terrain. 
Following this investigation PT. Intan Angkasa Airservice have performed several safety 
actions. The NTSC issued several safety recommendations to the Indonesia Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and PT. Intan Angkasa Airservice.

At 0117 UTC, the aircraft parked and flight crew shut down the left engine and activated the propeller brake on the right engine. After instructed the flight attendant to open the door, few seconds later, the NAC 2 OVHT (Engine Nacelles Overheat) warning at Centralized Crew Alerting System (CCAS) illuminated and the aural warning activated. After few second, the pilot heard somebody from the outside of the aircraft screamed requesting the fire extinguisher and in the cockpit the NAC 2 OVHT warning illuminated again followed by the right engine fire warning activated. The investigation considers the contribution factors of this accident was the fire initiated from the significant amount of accumulated fuel on the engine nacelle floor which then evaporated and reached auto ignited condition due to the high temperature in the right engine nacelle. As result of the investigation, the aircraft operator had performed safety action by updated the Engineering Authorization to accommodate the utilizing the special tools as required by the manufacture. The Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) consider the safety action taken by the aircraft operator was sufficient to prevent similar occurrence in the future"

PK-VVQ on Areal Survey Flight departed from Sepinggan-Balikpapan to Melak Area on 
25 April 2012 at 0440 UTC (Universal Time Coordinate) or 1240 LT. 
There were one pilot and one pasenger on board, the estimate flight endurance was seven 
hours. At 0505 the aircraft reported leaving Balikpapan Approach. 
At 0910 the aircraft was reported to Melak Radio it will be leaving the Survey Area at 
0930, and the aircraft was reportedly lost contact with Melak Radio at 0930. 
At 0922 a text message was sent by the passenger to his employer stating 
“Run out of fuel, landing on road”. 
The Search and Rescue Bureau informed that a distress signal was detected on 1025 at the 
position of 00 25’.02” N 116.02’.48”E, close to the village of Muaritan. 
The aircraft was in airworthy condition prior to departure. During the areal survey flight 
the engine was reported flamed out. 
The lack of fuel transferred from auxiliary tank caused the main tank to run dry and a loss 
of fuel feed to the engine, that caused the engine flame out. 
The aircraft failed to reach a suitable landing area. The horizontal pitch trim was set to the 
nearly full nose-up position and that the flaps were about half extended (16° - 18° versus 
38°).

At 0910 the aircraft was reported to Melak Radio it will be leaving the Survey Area at 0930, and the aircraft was reportedly lost contact with Melak Radio at 0930. At 0922 a text message was sent by the passenger to his employer stating “Run out of fuel, landing on road”. The Search and Rescue Bureau informed that a distress signal was detected on 1025 at the position of 00 25’. The lack of fuel transferred from auxiliary tank caused the main tank to run dry and a loss of fuel feed to the engine, that caused the engine flame out. The horizontal pitch trim was set to the nearly full nose-up position and that the flaps were about half extended (16° - 18° versus 38°). On 26 April 2012 at 0130 LT (1730 UTC) the aircraft was found substantially damaged at Muaritan – Kecamatan Tabang , Kutai Karta Negara about 50 meters from the local mining road.

Republic of Indonesia","On 16 March 2012 at 0702 LT (2202 UTC1) a Eurocopter AS350B3 helicopter registration 
PK-ODA departed from Timika Airport 2 Papua. The helicopter operated by PT. Airfast 
Indonesia was on an unscheduled charter flight by Freeport Indonesia Company. The flight 
was planned from Timika to Utikinagon (helipad) – Mile post (MP) 66 (helipad) – Wanagon 
(helipad) – MP 66 – Timika. 
The helicopter carried four passengers and food supplies to Utikinagon. At Utikinagon the 
helicopter dropped three passengers and food supplies then picked up another three 
passengers. The helicopter flew to MP 66 with four passengers on board. At MP 66 the 
helicopter disembarked three passengers and picked up the food supplies, to be delivered to 
Wanagon. 
At Wanagon the helicopter dropped one passenger and the food supplies and picked up two 
passengers and returned to MP 66. During the flight to MP 66, the pilot received a radio call 
to pick up one passenger from West Gully. West Gully is located approximately on radial 100 
from Wanagon and on the left side of the track to MP 66 which was approximately 180°. The 
pilot flew to West Gully and attempted to land twice but unsuccessful due to poor visibility. 
The pilot then decided to continue to MP 66. 
While approaching MP 66 the pilot could not land due to weather and decided to divert to 
Landville (MP 73). At 23.10 the pilot made radio call to company radio frequency and 
informed his intention to divert to MP 73. This was the last communication with the pilot. 
MP 73 located north east of MP 66 at lower elevation. Normally the ground visibility better 
than MP 66 and at several times diversion flights successfully land at MP 73. There was no 
radio room at MP 73 for the crew to make radio communication other than aircraft radio. 
At 23.17 Kilangin Tower controller received a phone call from Biak Flight Service Station 
(Biak FSS) officer informed that BASARNAS received a ELT (Emergency Locater 
Transmitter) distress signal at coordinate 04 07.9 S 137 04.5 E from PK-ODA at emergency 
radio frequency 121.5 MHz. 
Kilangin Tower controller confirmed the information to the AFE company frequency and 
exploration radio room, and was informed that PK-ODA has landed at MP 73. 
After 30 minutes from the last radio contact, there was no information received from the pilot. 
The MP 66 Manager contacted Wanagon and was informed that the helicopter was not at 
Wanagon. The MP 66 manager instructed a team to go to Landville by land vehicle to check 
the aircraft condition. 
At 02.08 Biak FSS officer reconfirmed the status of ELT distress signal to Kilangin Tower 
controller. Kilangin Tower controller reconfirmed to AFE company frequency and

exploration radio room. Exploration radio room officer informed that after the last 
communication at 23.10 there was no further information of the aircraft. AFE radio room 
officer informed that there was no aircraft landed at Landville (MP 73) as informed by the 
team deployed from MP 66. 
The Airfast Operation Base at Timika deployed two helicopters for search operation. The 
search operation was postponed due to bad weather. 
At 2200 on 17 March 2012, the Freeport search team from MP 66 found the helicopter 
position at coordinate 04° 07.34 S 137° 05.40 E at elevation of 8,000 feet. The helicopter was 
destroyed and all occupants were fatally injured. 
On 17 March 2012, the rescue team successfully evacuated the pilot and transferred to MP 66. 
On 19 March 2012 at 0000, the rescue team successfully evacuated the passengers and 
transported to MP 66. 
The evidence of aircraft impact into terrain without any systems malfunction is characteristic 
of a Controlled Flight IntoTerrain (CFIT). 
During the investigation the NTSC issued recommendation to the Directorate General Civil 
Aviation relating training requirements for pilots operating in remote and mountainous 
regions such as Papua.","['On 16 March 2012 at 0702 LT (2202 UTC1) a Eurocopter AS350B3 helicopter registration PK-ODA departed from Timika Airport 2 Papua', 'The helicopter operated by PT', 'Airfast

The brake assembly number 2 was replaced at the night stop before departed to Solo. 
The aircraft landed at 0158 UTC. During landing roll, the controller observed smoke on the 
left main landing gear and informed to the SLK pilot. The controller communicated in unclear 
English. The communication was assisted by the pilot of another aircraft by translating to and 
from Indonesia and English. 
For five minutes the pilot repeatedly asked Marmo Tower for more information to find out 
whether there was smoke and/or fire. At 0204 UTC, Marmo Tower said to the pilot that there 
was fire and the pilot made decision to conduct passenger emergency evacuation between the 
taxiway Bravo and apron. 
The passengers disembarked using emergency slides and one of the passengers had a minor 
injury. 
The investigation found no evidence that there had been fire.

Republic of Indonesia","On 26 December 2011, a Boeing 737-500 aircraft, registered PK-MDT, was being operated 
by PT. Merpati Nusantara Airline on a schedule passenger flight MZ 755 from Sam Ratulangi 
Airport (WAMM) Manado to Sultan Hasanuddin Airport (WAAA), Makassar.
.
There were 64 persons on board; two pilots, four cabin crews and 58 passengers consist of 49 
adults, 6 children and 3 infants.
The aircraft was on radar vector for ILS approach on runway 13, and the pilot had instructed 
to fly the aircraft direct to MKS for ILS runway 03. The weather condition during approach 
was raining with thunderstorm.
At 10.34 UTC the pilot reported to the controller that the aircraft established localizer runway 
13, on position 10 miles from touchdown runway 13. The pilot requested runway 13 for 
landing and it was approved by the Hasanuddin Tower (Aerodrome Control Tower) 
Controller.
At 10.38 UTC the aircraft landed on runway 13. After touchdown the aircraft veered to the 
right side of the runway, hit the taxi sign board and rolled on the shoulder for about 375 
meters then returned to the runway.
The pilot continued taxi and proceeded to parking stand number 7. The passengers 
disembarked normally at the parking stand and no one injured.
At the time of issuing this safety recommendation, the operator had been stopped the 
operation since January 2014. The recommendation is addressed to the DGCA to take the 
benefits from the investigation and this might be used as a lesson learned for the other 
operators, therefore the KNKT recommends that;
The operator should review the un-stabilised approach procedure and to include the un stabilised when crossing the runway threshold and directional control after touchdown.

Merpati Nusantara Airline on a schedule passenger flight MZ 755 from Sam Ratulangi Airport (WAMM) Manado to Sultan Hasanuddin Airport (WAAA), Makassar. There were 64 persons on board; two pilots, four cabin crews and 58 passengers consist of 49 adults, 6 children and 3 infants. The aircraft was on radar vector for ILS approach on runway 13, and the pilot had instructed to fly the aircraft direct to MKS for ILS runway 03. 34 UTC the pilot reported to the controller that the aircraft established localizer runway 13, on position 10 miles from touchdown runway 13. After touchdown the aircraft veered to the right side of the runway, hit the taxi sign board and rolled on the shoulder for about 375 meters then returned to the runway. At the time of issuing this safety recommendation, the operator had been stopped the operation since January 2014. The recommendation is addressed to the DGCA to take the benefits from the investigation and this might be used as a lesson learned for the other operators, therefore the KNKT recommends that;The operator should review the un-stabilised approach procedure and to include the un stabilised when crossing the runway threshold and directional control after touchdown"
71,72, ,KNKT.11.12.31.04,Boeing 737-200,24-Dec-11,"Sultan Mahmud Badarudin II Airport, 
Palembang, Sumatera Selatan,
 Republic of Indonesia","On 24 December 2011, a Boeing 737-200 aircraft, registered PK-CJD, was being operated by 
PT. Sriwijaya Air on a schedule passenger flight SJ 041 from Sultan Syarif Kasim II Airport 
(WIBB) Pekanbaru to Soekarno Hatta international Airport (WIII), Jakarta. 
There were 134 persons on board consisted; two pilots, four cabin crews and 128 passengers 
114 adult, 4 child and 7 infant. 
On 2000 feet after take-off from Pekanbaru, pilot observed that the hydraulic quantity System 
A was decreasing. The flap indicator pointed between UP and 1 degree and it was observed 
also that the Trailing Edge Flap Light indicator on AFT Overhead Panel shows green that 
mean the entire trailing edge flap was still not up position. On 5000 feet, pilot observed that 
the hydraulic System A totally loss. On FL250, pilot observed that the hydraulic quantity of 
System B also decreasing followed by autopilot disengage and pilot decided to divert to 
Sultan Machmud Badarudin II (WIPP) of Palembang. 
Initial contact was performed by pilot to APP Palembang on 12:28 UTC. The pilot informed 
that the aircraft had the hydraulic problem and PIC decided divert to Palembang airport. The 
Palembang ATC instructed the pilot to descent from FL250 to 2500 feet for VOR/ DME 
approach. The aircraft holding 4 times to reduce weight to achieved Maximum Landing 
Weight. 
After uneventfully landing, the aircraft was overrun at the stop way of runway 11 at 
coordinate 02° 54’ 09.5” S 104° 42’ 36.4” E. 
The evacuation performed as procedures, crew and passenger were no injured. 
The passenger picked up by airport bus to arrival hall. 
Engineer checked the aircraft and found the Hydraulic Hose of RH MLG up-lock actuator at 
the “Lock Port” position was leak. 
The factors contributed to this serious incident were as follows: 
1. Defective hydraulic hose of RH MLG Actuator at “Lock Port” position was made the 
hydraulic fluid drawn overboard. 
2. The defective hydraulic hose is likely consistent with fatigue mode initiated by fretting 
damage on the wire mesh as a result of vibration. 
3. It likely that loss of hydraulic system A followed by los of system B was due to the 
defective of EHSV P/N 73016 that led the Main Rudder PCU had excessive internal 
leak. 
Prior to issuing this final report, the NTSC has been informed several safety actions taken by 
PT. Sriwijaya. 
Included in this final report, the NTSC has issued several safety recommendations to the PT. 
Sriwijaya Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address the safety issues identified in this 
final report.

There were 134 persons on board consisted; two pilots, four cabin crews and 128 passengers 114 adult, 4 child and 7 infant. The flap indicator pointed between UP and 1 degree and it was observed also that the Trailing Edge Flap Light indicator on AFT Overhead Panel shows green that mean the entire trailing edge flap was still not up position. On FL250, pilot observed that the hydraulic quantity of System B also decreasing followed by autopilot disengage and pilot decided to divert to Sultan Machmud Badarudin II (WIPP) of Palembang. After uneventfully landing, the aircraft was overrun at the stop way of runway 11 at coordinate 02° 54’ 09. Engineer checked the aircraft and found the Hydraulic Hose of RH MLG up-lock actuator at the “Lock Port” position was leak. Defective hydraulic hose of RH MLG Actuator at “Lock Port” position was made the hydraulic fluid drawn overboard. The defective hydraulic hose is likely consistent with fatigue mode initiated by fretting damage on the wire mesh as a result of vibration. It likely that loss of hydraulic system A followed by los of system B was due to the defective of EHSV P/N 73016 that led the Main Rudder PCU had excessive internal leak"

Republic of Indonesia","On 20 December 2011, a Boeing 737-300 aircraft, registered PK-CKM, was being operated 
by PT. Sriwijaya Air on a schedule passenger flight SJ230 from Soekarno Hatta International 
Airport (WIII) Jakarta to Adisutjipto International Airport (WARJ), Yogyakarta. 
There were 141 persons on board; two pilots, four cabin crews and 135 passengers 
consisted124 adult, 7 children and 4 infant. 
The aircraft departed from Jakarta at 14.00 LT (07.00 UTC), the pilot in command was the 
pilot flying and the co-pilot was the pilot monitoring. At 08.10 UTC the aircraft made holding 
at 8 NM from JOG VOR due to bad weather. After the second holding and the weather was 
deteriorated, the airport authority closed the airport for takeoff and landing. The pilot 
requested divert to Juanda Airport (WARR), Surabaya and landed at 08.40 UTC. 
After refuelling and received the information about weather improvement in Yogyakarta then 
the aircraft departed, at 09.20 UTC, in this sequence of flight the PIC acted as PF, with 137 
persons on board consisted of two pilots, four cabin crews and 131 passengers consisted 120 
adult, 7 children and 4 infant. 
The aircraft was on the fifth sequence from seven aircraft approaching Adisucipto airport 
Yogyakarta. 
Passing JOG VOR it was seen on radar screen that the aircraft speed was read 203 Kts at 2700 
ft. Approach Controller instructed to reduce the speed. 
At about 1200 ft, the pilot had the runway insight and disengaged the autopilot and auto throttle. The pilot made correction to the approach profile by roll up to 25 degrees and rate of 
descend up to 2040 ft per minute. The GPWS warning of ‘pull up’ and sink ‘rate were’ 
activated. Aircraft touched down at speed 156 Kts of 138 Kts target landing speed. 
During landing roll, the auto-brake and spoiler activated automatically. The thrust reverse 
were deployed and the N1 were recorded on the FDR increase and decrease to idle before 
increased to 80% prior to aircraft stop. 
The PIC noticed that the aircraft would not be able to stop in the runway and decided to turn 
the aircraft to the left. The aircraft stopped at 75 meter from the end of runway 09 and 54 
meter on the left side of the centre line. 
Most of the passenger evacuated through left and right forward escape slides. All passengers 
were evacuated safely. The passenger on the stretcher case was evacuated by the airport 
rescue. 
6 passengers reported minor injured while all crew and the remaining passengers were not 
injured. The aircraft suffered major damage on the right main and nose wheel. 
The operator had issued several safety actions following this accident. The NTSC issued 
several safety recommendations to address safety issues identified in this investigation.

73,74, ,KNKT.11.12.29.04,Cessna 172P,19-Dec-11,"Karang Ampel, Cirebon, West Java
Republic of Indonesia","On 19 December 2011, a Cessna 172P aircraft registered as PK-WTF was being operated by 
Wings Flying School on a flight training from Cakrabhuwana Airport (WICD), Cirebon to 
Karang Ampel training area with Visual Flight Rules. On board the aircraft consisted of one 
flight instructor and one student. 
At 1233 LT (0533 UTC), the aircraft departed from Cirebon then flew via Suranengala to 
Karang Ampel area.
At 0545 UTC, the aircraft reached Karang Ampel area and conducted training exercises of 
climbing turn, steep turn, stall recovery, slow flight descend and engine failure exercise. 
During the engine failure exercise, the student pilot performed clearing engine procedure 
several times. At altitude 700 feet, the student pilot made a go around and climbed to intended 
altitude of 1,500 feet for returning to Cirebon. During climbing, the pilots saw that the engine 
power indicated 1,800 rpm, and the pilot felt that the engine was hesitating. The flight 
instructor then took over the aircraft control performed forced landing to coastline area at 
approximately 3 Nm north of checkpoint Suranenggala. 
The aircraft touched down on the muddy surface and flipped. The flight instructor and the 
student evacuated the aircraft and no one injured in this occurrence.
Investigation conducted examination to the engine to determine the cause of the engine 
failure. The engine examination did not find any abnormality. The examination of induction 
system found a piece of rubber at the inside of the throttle chamber of the carburetor with
dimension of 12 cm length and 0.8 cm width that believed originated from the flapper valve 
of the induction box. 
The detachment of the rubber presumably due to repeated bending action against the box wall 
at “CLOSE” position caused fatigue to the rubber.
The presence of the rubber in the throttle chamber interrupted the supply of fuel air mixture to 
the piston chamber and resulted in the improper combustion. The improper combustion was

The flight was conducted under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) The aircraft departed from Medan at 0728 LT (0028 UTC) and scheduled to be arrived at Kuta Cane at 0058 UTC. The aircraft was found impacted to a of 70º slope terrain at 5,055 feet altitude in the Leuser Mountain National Park, direction of 109 and 16 Nm from Kuta Cane on coordinate N 03024’ 00” E 0980 01’ 00”. The CVR revealed conversation between pilots, discussed about the cloudy weather and there was no gap of cloud to pass and both pilots agreed to fly into the cloud, consequently, the flight crew had lost visual references to the ground and no or late recovery action prior to impact. The National Transport Safety Committee (NTSC) considered the safety actions taken by the operator were sufficient to prevent an occurrence with similar cause and decide not issued safety recommendation to the operator"

Republic of Indonesia","The helicopter operated by PT. Airfast Indonesia and flow under the contract between PT. 
Airfast Indonesia and PT. Newmont Nusa Tenggara Mining Company, since 5 August 2011. 
At 25 September 2011, the helicopter was conducted an external load /sling operation with a 
50 feet long external cable. The flight route was between two camps at Lemurung and Dodo. 
The crew consisted of one pilot and one load master. 
At 0539 UTC, the helicopter took off to drop the load to Dodo and was returning to Lemurung 
with empty long-line hook. Approximately two minutes after the aircraft departed Dodo, the 
ground radio operator received a “MAYDAY MAYDAY” call on the company frequency. The 
Lemurung radio operator responded but no reply. 
A flight with an empty long-line is not according with the SOP of PT. Airfast Indonesia. 
At 0915 UTC, the signal from the helicopter’s Emergency Locater Transmitter (ELT) was 
received on coordinate 08º54’S 117º24’E. 
On 26 September 2011, at 0113 UTC, the helicopter was found at coordinate 08º54’00”S 
117º23’10”E approximately at 850 meters elevation. 
At 02.34 UTC a group of land search from Dodo reached the accident site. 
Both occupants were fatally injured. 
The tail rotor and tail rotor gearbox were not immediately located. These parts were found 
and recovered amidst vegetation at a rain forest several weeks after the accident about 300 
meters from the accident site approximately on the flight path. 
The examination of the cable (long-line) and the tail rotor blade provided evidence consistent 
with the tail rotor blade striking the cable. The cable strike, in turn, resulted in the tail rotor 
system entering an extreme out-of-balance condition, manifesting into loads that fractured 
the mounting bulkhead of the 90° gearbox and resulted an uncontrollable flight due to the 
significant shift to centre of gravity (CG). 
Following this investigation the NTSC issued several safety recommendations to the 
Indonesia Directorate General of Civil Aviation, and PT. Airfast Indonesia.

Since there was no message nor radio contact from the pilot until its ETA in Wamena, the Flight Following Officer at Sentani informed to the other personnel at the operation base, and alarmed to the other YAJASI aircraft which were flying in that area to start search the PK UCE. The investigation concluded the contributing factors as follows: • The pilot decided to descend from the cruise altitude 10000 feet to penetrate the area of marginal weather was most likely not as what his perceive. • The pilot avoided the cloud to the left of the VFR route guidance and most likely that the space available was less than the requirement stated for the Weather Minimum class F. Included in this final report, the NTSC has issued several safety recommendations to the Yayasan Jasa Aviasi Indonesia and Directorate General of Civil to address the safety issues identified on chapter 5 (five) in this report"
81,82, ,KNKT.11.09.17.04,Cessa 208 Grand Caravan,9-Sep-11,"Notnare Village, Distrik Samenage, Yahukimo, Papua Republic of Indonesia","On 9 September 2011, a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, registered PK-VVE, was being
operated by PT ASI Pudjiastuti Aviation on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Wamena
Airport to Kenyam Aerodrome in Papua. The flight was being conducted under the
visual flight rules (VFR) and the pilot reported to Air Traffic Control (ATC) that the
planned altitude was 9,500 feet. On board the aircraft were two pilots, a manifested load
of diesel drums and grocery items, and a non-manifested load of 25 bags of rice
weighing 827 lbs (375 Kg).
The aircraft took off from Wamena Runway 15 at 0317 UTC. The last communication
between the aircraft and Wamena ATC was at 0323 when the pilot reported over Polimo
passing 7,300 feet climbing to 9,500 feet with an Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at
Kenyam of 0347 UTC.
On 10 September 2011, a Search and Rescue team and local people commenced a
rescue operation. Two days later, the SAR team and local people reached the accident
site, which was located on the side of the mountain. Both of the persons on board were
fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed.
The aircraft was fitted with a number of devices that recorded various operational and
engine parameters. The investigation was able to recover data from each of the devices
and develop a sequence of events, based on the recorded data.
The following factors contributed to the accident;
The aircraft was loaded to a weight in excess of the maximum certificated takeoff
weight.
The aircraft climb performance was adversely affected by the aircraft being
operated above the certificated maximum takeoff weight. 
The aircraft approached high terrain along the proposed route at an altitude which
was below that specified in the operator's route guide.
The aircraft entered a high rate of descent during a terrain avoidance maneuver.
Recovery from the abnormal flight path was not achieved before the aircraft
collided with terrain.
As a result of the accident and during the investigation, the Directorate General of Civil
Aviation performed a special safety audit, and the operator issued and performed safety
actions.","['On 9 September 2011, a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, registered PK-VVE, was beingoperated by PT ASI Pudjiastuti Aviation on a non-scheduled cargo flight from WamenaAirport to Kenyam

Republic of Indonesia","On 22 July 2011, a Boeing 737-300 aircraft registered PK-GGO was being operated by PT. 
Garuda Indonesia Airways as a scheduled passenger flight GA 292, from Soekarno - Hatta 
International Airport (WIII) Jakarta to Abdul Rahman Saleh Airport (WARA) Malang. 
The flight crew member was three pilots which consist of Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as 
Pilot Monitoring (PM), First Officer (FO) who was under a line training acted as Pilot 
Flying (PF), Second in Command (SIC) a qualified FO acted as a third pilot occupied the 
pilot jump seat and 5 Flight Attendants (FA). The aircraft departed from Jakarta at 0546 
UTC and carried 100 passengers. 
During the flight there were no abnormal condition related to aircraft system or other 
significant information was reported. 
The ATC instructed the pilot to commence the VOR approach Runway 35 and circling 
Runway 17. The pilots were able to see the runway at approximate 4 DME and continued 
the circling procedure by joined circuit pattern of runway 17. When turned on the base leg 
runway 17, the PM saw and assessed that the aircraft was above the normal glide path, 
turned too early and the aircraft was on the right of the centerline. Realizing to the 
conditions, the PM decided to take over the control and continued the approach to land. The 
PIC tried to correct the glide path by increasing the rate of descend (ROD), reducing the 
power and rolled to bring the aircraft aligned with the runway centerline. 
At 0709 UTC, the aircraft touched down on runway 17 and was slightly deviated to the 
right of the runway centerline and stopped on the runway. The ATC instructed the pilot to 
stop the aircraft and verified of a probability of a hard landing which was confirmed by the 
pilot. The FDR recorded vertical acceleration of 3.473 G. 
There were no one injured in this occurrence. 
The investigation had determined that there were no issues with the aircraft and all systems 
were operating normally. The analysis was focus on these following 3 safety issues: 
• Un-stabilized approach below 500ft. 
• The decision to take over the control and continued the landing. 
The investigation concluded that the aircraft approach was un-stabilized since 500 ft prior 
to land. The decision to take over control during the un-stabilized approach was not 
consistent to the operator standard operating procedures as well as the Crew Resources 
Management (CRM) Policy implementation. 
At the time of issuing this Final Report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi has 
been informed of safety actions resulting from this accident by PT. Garuda Indonesia and 
the Indonesia Air Force Base Abdul Rahman Saleh as the airport operator. 
Included in this final report, the KNKT has issued several safety recommendations to the

Garuda Indonesia Airways as a scheduled passenger flight GA 292, from Soekarno - Hatta International Airport (WIII) Jakarta to Abdul Rahman Saleh Airport (WARA) Malang. The flight crew member was three pilots which consist of Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM), First Officer (FO) who was under a line training acted as Pilot Flying (PF), Second in Command (SIC) a qualified FO acted as a third pilot occupied the pilot jump seat and 5 Flight Attendants (FA). The pilots were able to see the runway at approximate 4 DME and continued the circling procedure by joined circuit pattern of runway 17. When turned on the base leg runway 17, the PM saw and assessed that the aircraft was above the normal glide path, turned too early and the aircraft was on the right of the centerline. The PIC tried to correct the glide path by increasing the rate of descend (ROD), reducing the power and rolled to bring the aircraft aligned with the runway centerline. The decision to take over control during the un-stabilized approach was not consistent to the operator standard operating procedures as well as the Crew Resources Management (CRM) Policy implementation. At the time of issuing this Final Report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi has been informed of safety actions resulting from this accident by PT. Garuda Indonesia and Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address the safety issues identified in this final report"
84,85, ,KNKT.11.05.10.04,Xi ’An Aircraft Industry MA60,7-May-11,"Utarom Airport, Kaimana - Papua Barat Republic of Indonesia","On 7 May 2011, an Xi ’An MA60 aircraft, registered PK-MZK was being operated by PT. 
Merpati Nusantara Airline as a scheduled passenger flight MZ 8968, from Domine Eduard 
Osok Airport, Sorong, Papua Barat to Utarom Airport (WASK), Kaimana1, Papua Barat. 
The accident flight was part of series of flight scheduled for the crew. The aircraft departed 
from Sorong at 0345 UTC2 and with estimated arrival time in Kaimana at 0454 UTC. In 
this flight, the Second in Command (SIC) was as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in 
Command (PIC) as Pilot Monitoring (PM). On board the flight were 2 pilots, 2 flight 
attendants, 2 engineers and 19 passengers consisting of 16 adults, 1 child and 2 infants. 
The flight from Sorong was planned under the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)3. The 
destination, Kaimana, had no published instrument approach procedure. Terminal area 
operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the 
Visual Flight Rules (VFR). 
At about 0425 UTC, after passing waypoint JOLAM the crew of MZ 8968 contacted 
Kaimana Radio and informed that the weather at Kaimana was raining, horizontal visibility 
of 3 to 8 kilometers, cloud Cumulonimbus broken at 1500 feet, south westerly wind at a 
speed of 3 knots, and ground temperature 29°C. 
The last communication with the crew of MZ 8968 occurred at about 0450 UTC. The flight 
crew asked whether there were any changes in ground visibility and the AFIS officer 
informed them that the ground visibility remained at 2 kilometer. The visual flight rules 
requires a visibility of minimum 5 km and cloud base higher than 1500 feet. 
The evidence indicates that during the final segment of the flight, both crew member were 
looking outside the aircraft to sight the runway. During this period the flight path of the 
aircraft varied between 376 to 585 feet and the bank angle increased from 11 to 38 degree 
to the left. 
                                                           
The rate of descent then increased significantly up to about 3000 feet per minute and 
finally the aircraft impacted into the sea. 
The accident site was about 800 meters south west of the beginning of runway 01 or 550 
meters from the coastline. Most of the wreckages were submerged in the shallow sea 
between 7 down to 15 meter deep. 
All 25 occupants were fatally injured. The aircraft was destroyed and submerged into the 
sea.

Terminal area operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). At about 0425 UTC, after passing waypoint JOLAM the crew of MZ 8968 contacted Kaimana Radio and informed that the weather at Kaimana was raining, horizontal visibility of 3 to 8 kilometers, cloud Cumulonimbus broken at 1500 feet, south westerly wind at a speed of 3 knots, and ground temperature 29°C. The visual flight rules requires a visibility of minimum 5 km and cloud base higher than 1500 feet. The evidence indicates that during the final segment of the flight, both crew member were looking outside the aircraft to sight the runway. During this period the flight path of the aircraft varied between 376 to 585 feet and the bank angle increased from 11 to 38 degree to the left.

When the aircraft joining left downwind abeam end of runway 04, the instructor sets the engine to the minimum power. On short final runway 04 the pilot assumes that the aircraft could not make perfect landing and then the pilot take over the aircraft. While the aircraft still continuing descend, pitch down and bank to the left the pilot apply full power as part of Go Around procedure. As the aircraft gaining more thrust, speed and rate of descend accelerated, and increasing spiralling slipstream of the propeller to the vertical stabilizer caused the aircraft more roll to the left, and the left wing tip hit the runway followed by propeller and nose wheel. The aircraft veered to the left and out of the runway, the aircraft stopped on left shoulder opposite the landing direction runway 04, at the coordinate of 6º44’11’’S 108º33’50”E"

Republic of Indonesia","On 15 February 2011, a Boeing 737-900 aircraft Registration PK-LHH operated by PT. Lion Mentari 
Airlines as a passenger service flight with flight number LNI 295 departed from Polonia International 
Airport, Medan (MES / WIMM) to Sultan Syarif Kasim II Airport, Pekanbaru (PKU/ WIBB). On 
board in this flight was 226 person, consist of two pilots, one observer pilot, five flight attendants and 
218 passengers (212 adults and six infant). The PIC acted as Pilot Flying on this flight 
At 10.55 UTC (17.55 LT) the aircraft landed at Sultan Syarif Kasim II Airport, Pekanbaru. Prior to 
land, the Tower controller informed that the wind was calm. There was also a PIREP1 informed that 
the runway was slippery. The weather condition slight rain and landed runway 36. While the aircraft 
on final approach after passed 500 feet until touched down, the FDR data revealed that there was tail 
wind with average component of 15 knots. 
The passengers evacuated normally via passenger stair and no one injured. 
The performance calculation based on the aircraft landing weight, approach speed, temperature, tail 
wind component and assumption of braking action medium indicated that the runway length available 
was not sufficient for the aircraft to stop on the runway. 
The examination on the runway found rubber deposit and several spots of standing water up to 3 cm 
depth. 
The investigation concluded that combination of tail wind component and runway skid resistant might 
have contributed to this serious incident. 
One day before this serious incident, there was another runway excursion serious incident in Sultan 
Syarif Kasin II Airport involving same type of aircraft of the same aircraft operator while landed on 
runway 36 during raining. 
Following this investigation, NTSC issued safety recommendations to address additional safety issues

On board in this flight was 226 person, consist of two pilots, one observer pilot, five flight attendants and 218 passengers (212 adults and six infant). While the aircraft on final approach after passed 500 feet until touched down, the FDR data revealed that there was tail wind with average component of 15 knots. The performance calculation based on the aircraft landing weight, approach speed, temperature, tail wind component and assumption of braking action medium indicated that the runway length available was not sufficient for the aircraft to stop on the runway. The investigation concluded that combination of tail wind component and runway skid resistant might have contributed to this serious incident. One day before this serious incident, there was another runway excursion serious incident in Sultan Syarif Kasin II Airport involving same type of aircraft of the same aircraft operator while landed on runway 36 during raining. Following this investigation, NTSC issued safety recommendations to address additional safety issues to be added to the NTSC report of the previous serious incident to the DGCA, and the aircraft operator"

Republic of Indonesia","On 14 February 2011, a Boeing 737-900 aircraft registration PK-LFI operated by PT. 
Lion Mentari Airlines as flight number LNI 392 departed from Soekarno-Hatta 
Airport, Jakarta (CGK / WIII) to Sultan Syarif Kasim II Airport, Pekanbaru (PKU/ 
WIBB). 
The pilot made holding and waited for weather improvement and decided to continue 
approach after the weather improved to above the minima for landing. 
At 14.20 UTC (21.20 LT) the aircraft landed at Sultan Syarif Kasim II Airport, 
Pekanbaru. The weather condition was rain and the runway was wet. Prior to land, the 
Tower controller gave clearance to land and informed that the wind was calm, while 
the pilot saw the wind condition on the Flight Management Computer (FMC) was tail 
wind up to 11 knot. The aircraft overrun and stop at the stop way with the right main 
wheels tricked at the corner of the stop way. 
The passengers evacuated normally via passenger stair and no one injured. 
The examination on the runway found rubber deposit and several spots of standing 
water up to 3 cm depth. 
The FDR data revealed that the aircraft reached the target of deceleration until the 
thrust reversers stowed at 1000 feet remaining runway length available when the 
aircraft speed approximately 70 knots. 
The investigation concluded that the aircraft was decelerated according to the 
preselected value until the thrust reversers stowed which was known at the last 1000 
feet of the runway available and the aircraft speed approximately 70 knots. According 
performance calculation the aircraft should be able to stop on the remaining runway 
available. The failure of the aircraft to stop most likely due to the significant 
deterioration of both the runway friction and brake effectiveness as result of the 
existing of the combination of the rubber deposit and water spots. 
Following this investigation, NTSC issued several safety recommendations to the

Republic of Indonesia","On 2 November 2010, a Boeing Company B737-400 aircraft, registered PK-LIQ, was being 
operated by Lion Mentari Airlines as a passenger schedule flight with flight number JT 712
from Soekarno Hatta Airport, Jakarta at 10.12 LT (03.12 UTC) to Supadio Airport, Pontianak. 
The Pilot in Command (PIC) was the pilot flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) was 
the pilot monitoring (PM).
The crew aware that the aircraft has problem on the difficulty of selection the thrust reversers 
and automatic speed brake deployment. This problem has been reported 13 times. 
The flight to Pontianak was normal and the pilot performed ILS approach to runway 15 in 
slight rain and wet runway. 
The FDR recorded that the approach was un-stabilized according to the Boeing B737 FCTM 
and require for go around.
After the aircraft touched down, the pilot reported that the thrust reverser was hard to operate 
and the speed brake did not auto-deploy. There was no deceleration felt by the crew. The FDR 
data revealed that the speed brake deployed 42 seconds after touchdown or 32 seconds after 
N1 increase. 
The aircraft run out of runway and stopped at approximately 70 meters from the runway or 10 
meters from the stop-way pavement. The PIC commanded to the flight attendants for 
passenger evacuation. No one injured and all passengers were evacuated through all available 
exits.
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors were;
Inconsistency to the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) for the rectifications 
performed during the period of the reversers and auto speed brake deployment 
problem was might probably result of the unsolved symptom problems. 
The decision to land during the un-stabilized approach which occurred from 1000 feet 
to 50 feet above threshold influenced by lack of crew ability in assessing to accurately 
perceive what was going on in the flight deck and outside the airplane. 
The effect of delayed of the speed brake and thrust reverser deployment effected to the 
aircraft deceleration which required landing distance greater than the available landing 
distance.
At the time of issuing this Final Report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi has
not been informed of safety actions resulting from this accident.
Includes in this final report, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations relates to 
operator maintenance program and flight operation procedures, wet runway safety and 
passenger survival aspects to the PT. Lion Air, PT. Angkasa Pura II Supadio Airport,

The FDR recorded that the approach was un-stabilized according to the Boeing B737 FCTM and require for go around. The investigation concluded that the contributing factors were;Inconsistency to the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) for the rectifications performed during the period of the reversers and auto speed brake deployment problem was might probably result of the unsolved symptom problems. The decision to land during the un-stabilized approach which occurred from 1000 feet to 50 feet above threshold influenced by lack of crew ability in assessing to accurately perceive what was going on in the flight deck and outside the airplane. The effect of delayed of the speed brake and thrust reverser deployment effected to the aircraft deceleration which required landing distance greater than the available landing distance. At the time of issuing this Final Report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi hasnot been informed of safety actions resulting from this accident. Includes in this final report, the KNKT issued several safety recommendations relates to operator maintenance program and flight operation procedures, wet runway safety and passenger survival aspects to the PT. Angkasa Pura II Supadio Airport, Pontianak and Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address the safety issues identified inthis final report"

Republic of Indonesia","On 9 July 2010, a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft registered PK-RJS was being 
operated by PT. Ekpress Transportasi Antarbenua (Premi Air) as a charter flight, from 
Wamena Airport (WMX / WAJW) Papua, to Kobakma Airstrip (KOB) Mamberamo, 
Papua. There were one flight crew and 9 passengers. 
The flight departed from Wamena at 21.46 UTC (06.46 WIT) to Kobakma. This was the 
second flight of the day with the same destination for the pilot. 
Normal flight conditions reported until approach the Kobakma Airstrip that it was covered 
with fog. The pilot decided to hold until the fog appeared to be clear. After approximately 
20 minutes of holding, the pilot reported that fog covered the key point on the final was 
disappearing. The pilot continued to join the left downwind Runway 09 than left base and 
aircraft touched down with slight stall warning horn engaged. 
The aircraft landed at Kobakma Airstrip at 22.23 UTC (07.23 WIT). During landing roll 
about near end of Runway 09, a small muddy gravel spot with stone rooted to the ground 
hit the aircraft left main wheel which caused the aircraft veer to the left out of the runway. 
The aircraft start veered to the left of out of the runway about 20 meters before the end 
marker and stop at 15 meters before left end marker. The aircraft stuck with pile of stones 
along the side of the runway. 
These stones were stack there in the purpose of runway hardener development project. The 
project did not start until the day of occurrence. 
The damage of the aircraft were all three propeller blades damage, lower cargo port fairing 
damage, left main landing fairing damaged and a hole on the left lower flap which caused 
fuel leaked out. 
All passengers were disembarked safely and no one was injured in this serious incident. 
The investigation concluded that the contributing factors of this serious incident are as 
follows: 
The aircraft either was coming well above the normal approach profile or floating 
over the runway resulted to the insufficient remaining landing distance. 
The complacency elements influenced to the pilot decision making.
The deceleration value of the left main tire was greater than the right main tire 
causing the aircraft veer off to the left.

were 52 persons on board; two pilots, one engineer, two flight attendants, one flight
dispatcher and 46 passengers (43 adults, one child, and two infants).
During the final approach for runway 04, the left ECU light illuminated followed by low oil
pressure and torque indications. It was reported that during the flight from Tanjung Redep/
Berau-Kalimaru Airport (BEJ),a failure of the left engine occurred whilethe aircraft was
approaching Samarinda (SRI). Samarinda air traffic control advised against an emergency
landing since the airport was situated in a residential area and the runway (04/22) length
was only 1,160 m (3,800 ft). The pilot decided to divert to Balikpapan - Sepingan Airport
(BPN), which was 92 km (50 NM) to the south. This airport had better facilities and a
longer runway (07/25, 2,500 meters/ 8,200 ft long). The Pilot in Command (PIC) decided to
go around, divert to Balikpapan, and carry out the QRH engine shut-down procedure.
They commenced the climb to 4000 ft with the left engine inoperative. Approximately 16
Nm from Balikpapan Airport, while climbing through 3,800 feet or approximately 1140
local time, the right ECU light illuminated, immediately followed by low oil pressure and
low torque indications. The right engine then failed. The crew broadcast a MAYDAY to
Balikpapan Approach and decided to conduct a forced landing into a clear field in the
Samboja area, about 16 Nm from the Balikpapan Airport.
After the aircraft came to a stop, the PIC initiated an evacuation. One passenger was
seriously injured.

fuel system to determine the reason(s) for the fuel starvation/exhaustion and related engine
failures. Fuel samples are also being analyzed. The investigation is also examining

Republic of Indonesia","At 2 December 2009, PK-MJD was on passenger schedule flight from Sultan Hasanuddin 
Airport, Makassar with destination El Tari Airport, Kupang, East Nusa Tenggara. The 
flight number was Merpati 5840 and carried 94 person on board consist of 88 passengers 
including four children and four infants, two pilot and four flight attendant. A 
maintenance engineer was on-board in this flight. Acting as pilot flying was the Second 
in Command (SIC) while the Pilot in Command acted as Pilot Monitoring. 
On approach, the pilot selected landing gear to down position. The left main landing gear 
indicator light was showed red, its means that the left main landing gear was not in down 
position and unsafe for landing. 
The pilot reported to the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) for a go-around and requested an 
area for holding to solve the problem. The ATC gave a clearance to hold over Kupang 
bay. 
The pilot tried to solve the problem by conducting the procedure according to the 
emergency checklist, including selected the landing gear by alternate selector. 
The pilot then requested to the ATC to fly at low altitude over the airport and asked to 
the ATC to observe the landing gear condition. The pilot also asked through the company 
radio for an engineer on-ground to observe visually the landing gear condition. 
The pilot then returned to the holding area, repeated the procedure but unsuccessful. 
Both pilots and engineer had a discussion and decided to attempt un-procedural method 
to make the landing gear down. Prior making these efforts the pilot announced to the 
passengers about the problem and their attempts that might be unpleasant to the 
passengers. 
After all attempts to lower the landing gear had failed, the pilot decided to land with the 
left main landing gear in up position. The pilot also asked the flight attendant to prepare 
for an abnormal landing. 
The ATC were prepared the airport fire fighting and ambulance, and also contacted the 
local police, armed forces, and hospitals and asking for additional ambulances. The ATC 
then informed the pilot that the ground support was ready. 
On short final the pilot instructed ‘brace for impact’ and the FA repeated that instruction 
to all passengers. 
The aircraft touched down at the touch down zone on runway 07. The pilot flying held 
the left wing as long as possible and kept the aircraft on the centre line, and the pilot 
monitoring shut down both engines.","['At 2 December 2009, PK-MJD was on passenger schedule flight from Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar with destination El Tari Airport, Kupang, East Nusa

100,101, ,KNKT.09.10.26.04,Boeing Company 737-300,30-Oct-09,"Soekarno – Hatta Airport, Jakarta
Republic of Indonesia","On 30 October 2009, a Boeing Company 737-300 aircraft, operated by Garuda 
Indonesia as flight GA142, registered PK-GGQ, was being flown on a scheduled 
passenger service from Soekarno–Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Sultan Iskandar Muda 
Airport, Banda Aceh, via Polonia Airport, Medan. There were 55 persons on board; 
two pilots, four flight attendants, and 49 passengers. 
The aircraft took off from Jakarta runway 07L at 0129 UTC. During the takeoff the 
number-two wheel separated from its axle and fell from the aircraft onto the runway. 
The air traffic controller subsequently informed the crew that one of the aircraft’s 
main wheels had fallen from the aircraft onto the runway during the takeoff. The pilot 
in command (PIC) decided to return to Jakarta. The controller informed the airport 
rescue and fire fighting service (RFFS), and RFFS personnel and vehicles stood by 
during the landing. 
The PIC taxied the aircraft off the runway and stopped it on taxiway NP1. The 
passengers disembarked normally via airstairs about 15 minutes after the landing. The 
RFFS crews were standing by the aircraft in case of a fire. None of the aircraft’s 
occupants were injured. 
The investigation determined that it was likely that the detachment of the number-two 
main wheel from its axle was due to the catastrophic failure of the wheel bearings. 
The bearing failures would then have resulted from an under-torque condition during 
the re-installation of the number-two main wheel, following the replacement of the 
brake unit. 
The recent main wheel installation was conducted on the airport apron during the 
hours of darkness, and flash lights were used to illuminate the work. The work 
environment was not conducive to ensuring that the work could be performed safely 
and in accordance with approved procedures. 
On 6 November 2009, PT. Garuda Indonesia informed the National Transportation 
Safety Committee that PT. GMF AeroAsia had commenced a number of safety 
actions to address safety concerns arising from this serious incident, including: a 
Quality Assurance Reminder drawing engineers’ attention to specific maintenance 
quality and safety requirements; a scheduled retraining program for engineers 
involved in wheel and brake replacement to be completed by 19 February 2010; and 
on 6 and 10 November issued Engineer Orders for Main Gear Wheel Axle Nut 
Torque Check and Bearing Inspection to be completed by 30 November 2009. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee issued recommendations to PT. GMF 
AeroAsia, PT. Garuda Indonesia, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, with 
respect to reviewing maintenance guidance documentation, training and supervision 
to ensure that correct practices are followed, and an appropriate maintenance 
environment is available. 
On 23 December 2009, PT. GMF AeroAsia submitted a Customer Originated Change

The air traffic controller subsequently informed the crew that one of the aircraft’s main wheels had fallen from the aircraft onto the runway during the takeoff. The investigation determined that it was likely that the detachment of the number-two main wheel from its axle was due to the catastrophic failure of the wheel bearings. The bearing failures would then have resulted from an under-torque condition during the re-installation of the number-two main wheel, following the replacement of the brake unit. The recent main wheel installation was conducted on the airport apron during the hours of darkness, and flash lights were used to illuminate the work. GMF AeroAsia had commenced a number of safety actions to address safety concerns arising from this serious incident, including: a Quality Assurance Reminder drawing engineers’ attention to specific maintenance quality and safety requirements; a scheduled retraining program for engineers involved in wheel and brake replacement to be completed by 19 February 2010; and on 6 and 10 November issued Engineer Orders for Main Gear Wheel Axle Nut Torque Check and Bearing Inspection to be completed by 30 November 2009. Garuda Indonesia, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, with respect to reviewing maintenance guidance documentation, training and supervision to ensure that correct practices are followed, and an appropriate maintenance environment is available. GMF AeroAsia submitted a Customer Originated Change to the Boeing Company requesting an amendment to the wheel nut torquing procedures for Boeing 737 aircraft. GMF AeroAsia also issued an Engineering Information document to its engineers detailing interim procedures pending the issuance of the Boeing amendment to the Boeing 737-345 Aircraft Maintenance Manual, which Boeing has indicated will be promulgated in September 2010"
101,102, ,KNKT.09.08.21.04,De Haviland DHC6 Twin Otter,2-Aug-09,"Near Ambisil / Okbibab, PAPUA
 Republic of Indonesia","On the morning of Sunday, 2 August 2009, a de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter 
aircraft, registered PK-NVC, operated by PT. Merpati Nusantara Airlines as flight 
number MZ-7960D, departed from Sentani Airport, Jayapura for Oksibil Airport. 
The flight was planned in accordance with the visual flight rules (VFR). There 
were 15 persons on board; two pilots, one engineer, 10 adult passengers and two 
infants. 
The estimated flight time was 50 minutes. The fuel on board was sufficient for 2 
hours and 50 minutes flight time. 
About 15 minutes prior to the estimated time of arrival at Oksibil the crew of 
another aircraft informed the Twin Otter crew that the weather in the Oksibil area 
was partly cloudy. There were no further reports of radio transmissions from the 
Twin Otter, and it did not arrive at Oksibil. 
A search was initiated at the time the aircraft would have run out of fuel. On the 
morning of 4 August 2009, searchers located the wreckage of the Twin Otter at an 
elevation of about 9,300 feet about 6 Nm from Oksibil. The aircraft was destroyed 
by impact forces, and all of the occupants were fatally injured. 
The pilots did not maintain visual flight procedures when flying below lowest safe 
altitude, and the aircraft was flown into cloud in the vicinity of gap north west of 
Oksibil. 
The accident was consistent with controlled flight into terrain. It was not 
survivable. 
As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety Committee 
issued recommendations to address safety issues identified in this report, 
specifically with respect to: maintenance procedures and maintenance inspection 
programs, to ensure that Emergency Locator Transmitters are serviceable; and the 
provision of weather information services for all civilian aircraft operations 
throughout Papua. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee also reissued recommendations to 
address safety issues identified in this report. (Previously issued on 23 December 
2009 in relation to the Pilatus PC-6/B2-H4 Turbo Porter aircraft, registered PK LTJ, that crashed on Mt Gergaji, Papua, on 17 April 2008)","['On the morning of Sunday, 2 August 2009, a de Havilland

Merpati Nusantara Airlines as flight number MZ-7960D, departed from Sentani Airport, Jayapura for Oksibil Airport. About 15 minutes prior to the estimated time of arrival at Oksibil the crew of another aircraft informed the Twin Otter crew that the weather in the Oksibil area was partly cloudy. On the morning of 4 August 2009, searchers located the wreckage of the Twin Otter at an elevation of about 9,300 feet about 6 Nm from Oksibil. The pilots did not maintain visual flight procedures when flying below lowest safe altitude, and the aircraft was flown into cloud in the vicinity of gap north west of Oksibil. As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety Committee issued recommendations to address safety issues identified in this report, specifically with respect to: maintenance procedures and maintenance inspection programs, to ensure that Emergency Locator Transmitters are serviceable; and the provision of weather information services for all civilian aircraft operations throughout Papua.

Republic of Indonesia","On 14 June 2009, a Dornier 328-100 aircraft, registration PK-TXN, was being
operated by PT. Travel Express Aviation Services (Expressair), flight number XN-9001,
on a scheduled passenger flight from Jayapura to Tanah Merah. The flight departed from
Jayapura at 2230 UTC (07:30 local time) with an estimated arrival time at Tanah Merah of
0017. There were 36 people on board; two pilots, one cabin crew, and 33 passengers.
The pilot in command (PIC) was pilot flying and the copilot was the support/monitoring
pilot.
The crew flew the aircraft overhead Tanah Merah and joined left downwind at 900 feet.
Final approach was reported to have been normal with VREF 105 knots.
The aircraft touched down at 0017, towards the departure at end of the runway 25
touchdown zones at Tanah Merah Airport, Boven Digoel, Papua. The crew reported that
the touched down was normal.
During the landing roll the PIC used reverse thrust to slow the aircraft. After a landing roll
of approximately 500 meters, reverse thrust was reduced and the condition levers were
selected to minimum. The crew reported that without warning, the aircraft diverged
abruptly to the right and they were not able to arrest the swing using full left rudder and
left brake. The aircraft left the runway and stopped on the shoulder approximately 10
meters away from the edge of runway, and approximately 600 meters from touchdown
area.
The right wheels sank into the soft ground of the runway shoulder, and the left wheels and
the nose wheels were on the shoulder. The right propeller blades fractured as they struck
the ground and the propeller assembly was torn from the engine and came to rest
approximately 4.5 meters from the right engine. The right engine was substantially
damaged.
The investigation is continuing and will include a detailed review of flight recorder data,
and operational procedures to determine if they may have contributed to this accident. The
State of Manufacture and the Dornier Type Certificate holder are assisting the
investigation.

The flight departed fromJayapura at 2230 UTC (07:30 local time) with an estimated arrival time at Tanah Merah of0017. The aircraft touched down at 0017, towards the departure at end of the runway 25touchdown zones at Tanah Merah Airport, Boven Digoel, Papua. After a landing rollof approximately 500 meters, reverse thrust was reduced and the condition levers wereselected to minimum. The crew reported that without warning, the aircraft divergedabruptly to the right and they were not able to arrest the swing using full left rudder andleft brake. The investigation is continuing and will include a detailed review of flight recorder data,and operational procedures to determine if they may have contributed to this accident"

REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA","On the afternoon of 30 April 2009, a Beechcraft Sundowner C23 aircraft, 
registered PK-ANW, operated by Sekolah Tinggi Penerbangan Indonesia (STPI), 
on a local training flight from Budiarto Airport (Curug), Tangerang, Banten, 
Indonesia, impacted terrain about 13 km southwest of the aerodrome. 
Thunderstorms, strong wind, and heavy rain were in the area at the time. 
There were three persons on board the aircraft; one flight instructor and two 
student pilots. The instructor was fatally injured, and the two student pilots were 
seriously injured. 
The aircraft was airworthy during when it departed from Curug. It was destroyed 
by the impact forces, and the damage to the aircraft was consistent with it being in 
an aerodynamically stalled condition at the time of impact. 
During the investigation it was concluded that there was a lack of supervision and 
instruction from STPI regarding the aircraft’s continued operation in adverse 
weather condition. Those requirements were documented in the STPI operating 
handbooks. 
It was also concluded that the injuries sustained by two of the occupants during the 
impact were the result of them not having properly worn their safety harnesses. 
Other safety issues were identified during the investigation. They included ground based very high frequency radio communication equipment and ground-based wind 
direction indication equipment. Those issues did not contribute to the accident, but 
were identified as safety deficiencies.

Republic of Indonesia","On the morning of 17 April 2009, a Pilatus PC-6/B2-H4 Turbo Porter aircraft, 
registered PK-LTJ, operated by PT. Mimika Air, charter flight from Ilaga to Mulia 
in the Puncak Jaya District of Papua. The Mimika Local Government owned the 
aircraft. There were 11 people on board; one pilot, one observer, and nine 
passengers comprised of eight adults and one infant. The aircraft was also carrying 
National Government election boxes. 
The flight in accordance with the visual flight rules was estimated to take 18 
minutes. There was no record of communication with the aircraft during the flight. 
Two minutes after the estimated time of arrival, when the Porter had not arrived, a 
search was commenced. On 18 April, search aircraft located the wreckage of the 
Porter at an elevation of about 12,000 feet on Mt Gergaji. The location was on the 
direct track between Ilaga and Mulia. The aircraft impacted the ground in an 
inverted attitude, and was destroyed by the impact forces and the post-impact fire. 
All occupants were fatally injured. 
The weather in the valleys along the route was mostly clear, with cloud on the 
mountains. The route flown by the pilot was the direct track, which passed over a 
mountain range, with a high peak adjacent to, and west of the track at about the 
midway point, at 13,700 feet. 
The investigation determined that it was likely that the pilot had flown the aircraft 
into cloud and lost control of the aircraft in instrument meteorological conditions. 
The impact signature was consistent with uncontrolled flight at the time of impact. 
This probably resulted from the pilot becoming spatially disoriented after entering 
cloud. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee made recommendations to the 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation relating to pilot licensing and route 
familiarization for pilots operating in remote and mountainous regions such as 
Papua. Particular attention should be given to visual flight operations in 
mountainous and unpredictable weather conditions","['On the morning of 17 April 2009, a Pilatus PC-6/B2-H4 Turbo Porter aircraft, registered PK-LTJ, operated by PT', 'Mimika Air, charter flight from

Mimika Air, charter flight from Ilaga to Mulia in the Puncak Jaya District of Papua. On 18 April, search aircraft located the wreckage of the Porter at an elevation of about 12,000 feet on Mt Gergaji. The route flown by the pilot was the direct track, which passed over a mountain range, with a high peak adjacent to, and west of the track at about the midway point, at 13,700 feet. The investigation determined that it was likely that the pilot had flown the aircraft into cloud and lost control of the aircraft in instrument meteorological conditions. The National Transportation Safety Committee made recommendations to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation relating to pilot licensing and route familiarization for pilots operating in remote and mountainous regions such as Papua. Particular attention should be given to visual flight operations in mountainous and unpredictable weather conditions"
105,106, ,KNKT 09.12.04.01,British Aerospace BAe 146-300,9-Apr-09,"Wamena Airport, Papua
Republic of Indonesia","On the morning of 9 April 2009, a British Aerospace BAe 146-300 aircraft, 
registered PK-BRD, was being operated by PT. Aviastar Mandiri Airlines as a 
scheduled passenger and cargo flight from Sentani Airport to Wamena 
Airport, Papua. The crew consisted of two pilots, two flight attendants, an 
engineer, and a load master. 
The aircraft performed a go-around from the initial landing approach on 
runway 15 at Wamena. The flight crew positioned the aircraft on a right 
downwind leg for another landing approach. As the aircraft was turned 
towards the final approach for the second landing approach at Wamena it 
impacted terrain and was destroyed. All of the occupants were fatally injured. 
The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) manufacturer 
performed simulations using data from the flight recorders, and two separate 
terrain data sources. The manufacturer informed the investigation that “the 
GPWS/EGPWS alerts recorded in the CVR were issued as designed”. 
However the enhanced Look-Ahead function appeared to have been inhibited 
following the go around. There was no evidence from the CVR that the crew 
had deliberately inhibited the terrain function of the EGPWS. The 
investigation determined that the EGPWS issued appropriate warnings to the 
flight crew, in the GPWS mode. 
The pilot in command did not take appropriate remedial action in response to 
repeated EGPWS warnings. The investigation concluded that flight crew’s 
lack of awareness of the aircraft’s proximity with terrain, together with non 
conformance to the operator’s published operating procedures, resulted in the 
aircraft’s impact with terrain. 
As a consequence of this accident, the operator took safety action to address 
deficiencies in its documentation for missed approach procedures at Wamena. 
As a result of this accident, the National Transportation Safety Committee 
(NTSC) also issued safety recommendations to the operator and to the 
Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) to ensure that relevant 
documented safety procedures are implemented. 
During the investigation, safety issues were identified concerning modification 
of aircraft and DGCA approval of those modifications. While those safety 
issues did not contribute to the accident, they nevertheless are safety 
deficiencies. Accordingly, the NTSC report includes recommendations to 
address those identified safety issues.","['On the morning of 9 April 2009, a British Aerospace BAe 146-300 aircraft, registered PK-BRD, was being operated by PT', 'Aviastar Mandiri Airlines as a

During the approach to runway 25L at Jakarta, the weather at the airport was reported 
as wind direction 200 degrees, wind speed 20 knots, visibility 1,000 meters, and rain. 
The PIC reported that he decided to take over control from the copilot. 
The PIC later reported that he had the runway in sight passing through 1,000 feet on 
descent, and he disengaged the autopilot at 400 feet. At about 50 feet the aircraft 
drifted to the right and the PIC initiated corrective action to regain the centreline. The 
aircraft touched down to the left of the runway 25L centerline and then commenced to 
drift to the right. The PIC reported that he immediately commenced corrective action 
by using thrust reverser, but the aircraft increasingly crabbed along the runway with 
the tail to the right of runway heading. The investigation subsequently found that the 
right thrust reverser was deployed, but left thrust reverser was not deployed. 
The aircraft stopped at 0835 on the right side of the runway 25L, 1,095 meters from 
the departure end of the runway on a heading of 152 degrees; 90 degrees to the 
runway 25L track. The main landing gear wheels collapsed, and still attached to the

Republic of Indonesia","On 23 February 2009, a Boeing McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft, registered PK-LIO, 
operated by Lion Air as flight number LNI-972, was scheduled to depart Polonial Airport 
Medan at 16.35 LT (09.35 UTC1
) for Hang Nadim Airport – Batam (Kepulauan Riau). The 
crew consisted of two pilots and four flight attendants. There were 156 passengers; 148 
adults, four children, and four infants. 
After takeoff, during the landing gear up procedure, the pilot noted one red light illuminate 
(nose gear) on the landing gear panel. During the investigation the pilots reported that they 
recycled the landing gear and the subsequent cockpit indication was that the landing gear was 
in the up and locked position. The pilots continued the flight to the planned destination Hang 
Nadim Aiport, Batam. 
During final approach at Batam, the pilots noted that the red light nose gear indicator was 
illuminated. The pilot in command (PIC) decided to conduct a go around and hold to perform 
the emergency checklist to attempt to extend the nose landing gear. After many attempts to 
extend the landing gear, the nose landing gear red indicator light remain illuminated. The PIC 
decided to make an emergency landing on runway 04 without the nose landing gear extended. 
The aircraft subsequently stopped on the runway 04 on the centre line. 
Emergency personnel and vehicles from Hang Nadim Airport prepared for the emergency, 
and laid foam on the runway before the aircraft landed, to eliminate fire hazard. 
The passengers and crew evacuated via the left front door escape slide. None of the occupants 
were injured. 
The initial investigation found that the nose landing gear spray (water) deflector had 
fractured, jamming the nose landing gear in the up position. 
The investigation is continuing and will include the operational procedures used during the 
flight to address the landing gear malfunction, and analysis of the mode of failure of the nose 
landing gear spray deflector. 
With the issue of the Preliminary Factual Report, the NTSC made recommendations covering 
the inspection of nose landing gear spray deflectors fitted to MD-90 aircraft.

After takeoff, during the landing gear up procedure, the pilot noted one red light illuminate (nose gear) on the landing gear panel. The pilot in command (PIC) decided to conduct a go around and hold to perform the emergency checklist to attempt to extend the nose landing gear. Emergency personnel and vehicles from Hang Nadim Airport prepared for the emergency, and laid foam on the runway before the aircraft landed, to eliminate fire hazard. The initial investigation found that the nose landing gear spray (water) deflector had fractured, jamming the nose landing gear in the up position. The investigation is continuing and will include the operational procedures used during the flight to address the landing gear malfunction, and analysis of the mode of failure of the nose landing gear spray deflector. With the issue of the Preliminary Factual Report, the NTSC made recommendations covering the inspection of nose landing gear spray deflectors fitted to MD-90 aircraft"
108,109, ,KNKT 09.01.01.04,Boeing 737-400,16-Jan-09,"Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar, South Sulawesi
Republic of Indonesia","On 16 January 2009, a Boeing Company 737-400 aircraft, registered PK-MDO, was 
being operated on an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) scheduled passenger service from 
Sultan Hasanuddin Airport Makassar as flight MZ 762, with an intended destination 
of Frans Kaisiepo Airport, Biak. There were two pilots, five flight attendants, and 164 
passengers on board including 14 infants. 
The co-pilot was intended to be the handling pilot on this sector, while the Pilot in 
Command (PIC) was the support/monitoring pilot. 
The flight was the second flight sector of the day for the pilots and the aircraft, after 
the first departure from Soekarno–Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Makassar. There was no 
abnormality reported on the first sector. The actual aircraft turn around time at 
Makassar was about 55 minutes prior the next departure. 
The crew taxied out off apron and proceed to runway 31 for departure. There was 
another aircraft taxied out before them. The crew elected to taxi slowly to prevent 
hold on short of runway to give sufficient distance to the traffic ahead. The crew 
successfully managed the taxi speed and entered the runway for departure without 
stopping the aircraft. 
The aircraft had a total takeoff weight of 60,400 kg and was configured for a takeoff 
with flap 5. The V1 for this weight and configuration was 145 knots. 
Weather at the airport was raining and the runway was wet. The crew used full thrust 
take off power. 
The aircraft started to roll for takeoff. The PIC set the takeoff thrust while the co-pilot 
as pilot flying controlled the direction of the aircraft. The PIC call “80” to the co-pilot 
as the aircraft’s speed passed 80 knots. At a speed of approximately 125 kts, the PIC 
noticed a vibration on the aircraft and the acceleration discontinued. The PIC elected 
to abort the takeoff by retarding both thrust levers to idle and selecting to reverse 
thrust. The co-pilot reported that he noticed the speed brake lever extended and the 
auto brake disarm light illuminated, while the aircraft speed decelerated through 80 
knots. 
The PIC controlled the aircraft to keep it on the centreline by using the rudder pedal. 
The aircraft decelerated and when it reached the normal taxi speed, the PIC turned the 
aircraft to the left into the runway turning area. He intended to taxi the aircraft back to 
the apron. An airport security officer who was close to the aircraft and witnessed the 
incident, gave a hand signal to the PIC indicating that taxi should not be continued. 
The PIC stopped the aircraft on the runway turning area. Both left tires were severely 
damaged. Both right main wheel tires deflated as the fuses had melted by overheat. 
Part of the left main landing gear door detached. 
No one was injured during this serious incident.","['On 16 January 2009, a Boeing Company 737-400 aircraft, registered PK-MDO, was being operated on an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) scheduled

There were two pilots, five flight attendants, and 164 passengers on board including 14 infants. The flight was the second flight sector of the day for the pilots and the aircraft, after the first departure from Soekarno–Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Makassar. The actual aircraft turn around time at Makassar was about 55 minutes prior the next departure. The crew elected to taxi slowly to prevent hold on short of runway to give sufficient distance to the traffic ahead. The crew successfully managed the taxi speed and entered the runway for departure without stopping the aircraft. The co-pilot reported that he noticed the speed brake lever extended and the auto brake disarm light illuminated, while the aircraft speed decelerated through 80 knots. The aircraft decelerated and when it reached the normal taxi speed, the PIC turned the aircraft to the left into the runway turning area. An airport security officer who was close to the aircraft and witnessed the incident, gave a hand signal to the PIC indicating that taxi should not be continued"
109,110, ,KNKT 08.28.12.04,Twin Otter DHC6-400,12-Dec-08,"Ewer Airstrip, West Papua, Papua
Republic of Indonesia","On 12 December 2008, a de Havilland DHC 6-300 Twin Otter aircraft, registered PK BRS, was being operated by PT. Aviastar Mandiri on a series of scheduled flights 
from Timika, Papua. 
The last flight of the day was a return flight from Timika to Ewer, about 36 minutes 
each way. The copilot was the handling pilot for the flight sector from Ewer to 
Timika, and the PIC was the support/monitoring pilot. 
The PIC reported that the aircraft commenced sliding before brakes release, and 
shortly after commencing the take-off roll the aircraft veered to the right, so he took 
over control from the copilot. However, he was unable to prevent the aircraft from 
swinging to the left and it rolled through the centreline to the left side of the runway. 
The PIC aborted the take off and attempted to regain the runway centreline from the 
left using nose-wheel steering. That attempt was unsuccessful, and the aircraft veered 
further left and slid off the runway into wet soft ground on the edge of the marsden 
matting runway. It came to a stop 360 meters from the departure end of the runway on 
a heading of 190 degrees. 
The PIC shut down the engines and instructed the copilot to disembark the 
passengers. None of the aircraft’s occupants were injured. 
The investigation was unable to determine why the pilots were unable to maintain 
directional control during the take-off roll. It is likely that in taking control from the 
copilot, and using nose-wheel steering, the PIC may have over corrected, resulting in 
a loss of directional control. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) made recommendations to 
the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to require aircraft operators to 
ensure that airstrips in remote locations have an effective means of communicating 
with regional authorities in the event of an accident or serious incident. 
The NTSC also recommended that the DGCA require Indonesian airport operators to 
inspect the marsden matting runway and ensure that there are no exposed locating 
pins or other objects that could present a hazard to aircraft, and that traction can be 
assured in wet conditions.

However, she cannot pushed rudder pedal due to the seat was retract to the backward and then the aircraft un-controlled. The investigation found the shimmy damper was not functional, caused there were vapor inside and then failed reduces the vibration during landing roll. The investigation found that the pin not inserted correctly in the hole track due to the handle improper lock. As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety Committee issued safety recommendations to the Indonesian Civil Aviation Institute"
111,112, ,KNKT/08.26/09.02.39,DORNIER 328-100,6-Nov-08,"FAK-FAK, PAPUA
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA","On 6 November 2008, an aircraft Dornier 328-100 TP, registration PK-TXL 
operated by Express Air flight number Express 9000, was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Manado to Fak-Fak, Papua via Sorong. The flight 
departed from Manado at 21:15 UTC (06:15 WIT) with an estimated arrival time at 
Fak-Fak of 01:33 UTC. There were 36 people on board; consist of three pilots, one 
cabin crew, and 32 passengers. 
The aircraft touched down heavily approximately 5 meters before the touch-down 
area of runway 10 at Torea Airport, Fak-Fak at 01:33. The investigation found that 
the left main landing gear touched the ground first (5 meters before the end of the 
runway), and the right main landing gear touched the ground (4.5 meters from the 
end of the runway). 
It stopped on the runway, approximately 700 meters from the touch-down area. The 
left main landing gear fractured in two places; at the front pivot point, and the aft 
pivot point. The left fuselage contacted the runway surface 200 meters from the 
touch-down point and the aircraft slid with the left fuselage on the ground for a 
further 500 meters, before it stopped at the right edge of the runway. The wing tip 
and left propeller blade tips also touched the runway and were damaged. 
The passengers and crew disembarked normally; there were no injuries. 
Following an inspection of the landing gear and temporary replacement of the 
damaged left main landing gear, the aircraft was moved to the apron on 8 November 
2008 at 04:00. The runway was closed for 5 days. 
The Digital Flight Data Recorder data showed evidence that the aircraft descended 
suddenly and rapidly when it was on short final approach. About 65 seconds before 
ground impact, the RPM of both propellers commenced to decrease to approximately 
70% with the NH increasing to 85%. Propeller RPM then suddenly reduced, 
followed by an immediate and rapid increase of propeller RPM to 111% left and 
97% right, then just as sudden and rapid, the left propeller RPM reduced to 77% and 
the right to 80%. Given that the propellers are constant speed units, the sudden and 
rapid changes could not be explained other than the probability that a crew member 
had made the control inputs. 
The PIC (pilot monitoring/flight instructor) did not monitor the operation of the 
aircraft sufficiently to ensure timely and effective response to the pilot induced 
excessive sink rate. 
The pilots did not communicate appropriately during the approach and landing, 
resulting is poor crew resource management (CRM). There was no evidence that any 
of the pilots had completed any form of CRM training for more than 9 years. Other 
than the handling pilot, there was no evidence that the other pilots had completed 
ALAR/CFIT training. 
The operator did not have a Line Operations Safety Audit Program (LOSA), and the 
airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standard with respect to runway end safety 
areas. 
Safety action taken following the accident involved the airport authority raising the 
level of the undershoot area to the same level as the runway, and the aircraft operator 
providing the pilots with further flight training. 
The NTSC made a number of recommendations covering the following: crew 
resource management implementation training; the use of the Flight Safety 
Foundation (FSF) Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction awareness training 
material; Line Operations Safety Audits; airport emergency planning and response; 
and the requirement for runway end safety areas at Fak Fak, Papua.","['On 6 November 2008, an aircraft Dornier 328-100 TP, registration PK-TXL operated by Express Air flight number Express 9000, was

The aircraft touched down heavily approximately 5 meters before the touch-down area of runway 10 at Torea Airport, Fak-Fak at 01:33. The left fuselage contacted the runway surface 200 meters from the touch-down point and the aircraft slid with the left fuselage on the ground for a further 500 meters, before it stopped at the right edge of the runway. Following an inspection of the landing gear and temporary replacement of the damaged left main landing gear, the aircraft was moved to the apron on 8 November 2008 at 04:00. Given that the propellers are constant speed units, the sudden and rapid changes could not be explained other than the probability that a crew member had made the control inputs. The PIC (pilot monitoring/flight instructor) did not monitor the operation of the aircraft sufficiently to ensure timely and effective response to the pilot induced excessive sink rate. The operator did not have a Line Operations Safety Audit Program (LOSA), and the airport did not meet the ICAO Annex 14 Standard with respect to runway end safety areas. Safety action taken following the accident involved the airport authority raising the level of the undershoot area to the same level as the runway, and the aircraft operator providing the pilots with further flight training. The NTSC made a number of recommendations covering the following: crew resource management implementation training; the use of the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction awareness training material; Line Operations Safety Audits; airport emergency planning and response; and the requirement for runway end safety areas at Fak Fak, Papua"

company activities from Halim Perdanakusuma Airport, Jakarta to Pangandaran 
(Nusawiru Aerodrome), West Java. There were three persons on board; one pilot, and 
two passengers who were Susi Air employees. 
The aircraft was refuelled with the Jet A-1 type fuel; total fuel on board was 132 liters. 
After departure from Halim Airport, the pilot reported tracking via BUANA at 7,000 feet. 
Bandung Control instructed the pilot to track on the 315 degree radial of the Bandung 
VOR. The pilot was subsequently cleared to continue climbing to his requested level 9,500 
feet. The pilot informed investigators that when he was approaching 8,700 feet, the engine 
power reduced to 75% and the ECU A inoperative indicator illuminated. That was followed 
by the ECU B inoperative indicator illuminating. The engine failed at 9,200 feet. 
The pilot said that he tried to restart the engine with various combinations of power settings 
and electrical load. No power developed and the propeller continued to windmill. The pilot 
was unable to restart the engine. 
At 0530 UTC the pilot conducted a forced landing at the Infantry Training Center 
shooting range, Cipatat, Padalarang, West Java. 
The aircraft was substantially damaged, but the occupants were not injured and

Republic of Indonesia","On 20 October 2008, a Boeing Company Mc Donnell Douglas DC9-82 aircraft, 
registered PK-LMS, was being operated on a scheduled passenger service from 
Jakarta Soekarno–Hatta Airport to Juanda Airport, Surabaya. There were 174 
persons on board; three pilots, four flight attendants, and 167 passengers. 
The pilot flying was a candidate First Officer (copilot) under training, and the Pilot 
in Command (PIC) was the instructor acting as the support/monitoring pilot. One 
qualified copilot occupied the jump seat in the cockpit. 
The pilots subsequently reported that the approach to Surabaya was normal. 
The crew of an aircraft holding at the runway intersection reported that a main 
wheel detached from LMS as it touched down. 
The crew of LMS taxied the aircraft to the apron, and during the transit check 
found that the number-two main wheel (left inboard main landing gear) was not on 
the aircraft. The wheel was subsequently found on the runway shoulder, on the 
right side of the runway. 
None of the aircraft’s occupants were injured and they disembarked normally. 
The investigation found that the worn inner threads of the axle number two (left 
main landing gear) caused the detachment of the axle nut and the separation of the 
wheel from the axle wheel number two. The strength and tightness of the thread 
joint could not be assured by the magnitude of tightening torque. 
The power source to the aircraft’s flight recorders was left on during the ground 
inspection immediately following the serious incident, so all cockpit voice data was 
overwritten and not available to the investigation. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) issued recommendations to 
PT. Wings Abadi Airlines during the investigation to inspect the fleet to ensure the 
serviceability of landing gear axle threads. The NTSC also recommended that the 
airline should promulgate procedures requiring flight crew and maintenance 
personnel to deactivate the power source to flight recorders as soon as practicable 
after an accident or serious incident. The NTSC also urged the DGCA to ensure 
that Indonesian operators have flight recorder deactivation procedures and they are 
implemented.","['On 20 October 2008, a Boeing Company Mc Donnell Douglas DC9-82 aircraft, registered PK-LMS, was being operated on a scheduled passenger service from Jakarta Soekarno–Hatta Airport to

The crew of LMS taxied the aircraft to the apron, and during the transit check found that the number-two main wheel (left inboard main landing gear) was not on the aircraft. The investigation found that the worn inner threads of the axle number two (left main landing gear) caused the detachment of the axle nut and the separation of the wheel from the axle wheel number two. The power source to the aircraft’s flight recorders was left on during the ground inspection immediately following the serious incident, so all cockpit voice data was overwritten and not available to the investigation. Wings Abadi Airlines during the investigation to inspect the fleet to ensure the serviceability of landing gear axle threads. The NTSC also recommended that the airline should promulgate procedures requiring flight crew and maintenance personnel to deactivate the power source to flight recorders as soon as practicable after an accident or serious incident. The NTSC also urged the DGCA to ensure that Indonesian operators have flight recorder deactivation procedures and they are implemented"
114,115, ,KNKT 08.10.21.04,Boeing Company 737–400,20-Oct-08,"Sultan Hasanuddin Airport, Makassar, South Sulawesi
Republic of Indonesia","On 20 October 2008, a Boeing B 737-400 aircraft, registered PK-MDO, was being 
operated under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) scheduled for passenger service from Sultan 
Hasanuddin Airport Makassar as flight MZ 762,with an intended destination of Moses 
Kilangin airport, Timika, Papua. There were 172 people on board; two pilots, five flight 
attendants, 165 passengers including 9 infants. 
The flight was the second flight sector of the day for both pilots as well as the aircraft, after 
the first departure from Soekarno Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Makassar. No abnormality was 
observed on the first sector. The actual aircraft turn around time at Makassar was about 50 
minutes prior the next departure. 
At 0205 UTC the aircraft started to roll for takeoff. The PIC heard a call “80” from the co pilot as the aircraft’s speed passed 80 knots. At approximately 130 knots, and before the 
PIC heard the co-pilot call “V1”, he noticed a blast noise followed by the aircraft veering to 
the left. The PIC elected to abort the take off by retarding both thrust levers to idle and 
activate the thrust reverser and subsequently the co-pilot reported that he noticed the speed 
brake lever extended and the auto-brake disarm light illuminate as the aircraft decelerated 
through 80 knots. 
The PIC controlled the aircraft to keep it on the centreline by used the rudder pedals. When 
the aircraft reached the normal taxi speed, the PIC turned the aircraft to the left onto the 
runway turning area. He intended to taxi the aircraft back to the apron. 
An airport security officer, who was close to the aircraft and witnessed the incident, gave a 
hand signal to the PIC indicating that the aircraft should stop. 
The PIC stopped the aircraft on the runway turning area. 
None of the aircraft’s occupants was injured during this serious incident.","['On 20 October 2008, a Boeing B 737-400 aircraft, registered PK-MDO, was being operated under Instrument Flight Rules

At approximately 130 knots, and before the PIC heard the co-pilot call “V1”, he noticed a blast noise followed by the aircraft veering to the left. The PIC elected to abort the take off by retarding both thrust levers to idle and activate the thrust reverser and subsequently the co-pilot reported that he noticed the speed brake lever extended and the auto-brake disarm light illuminate as the aircraft decelerated through 80 knots. An airport security officer, who was close to the aircraft and witnessed the incident, gave a hand signal to the PIC indicating that the aircraft should stop"

Republic of Indonesia","On 2 October 2008, a Boeing Company 737-4K5 aircraft, registered PK-GWT was being 
operated on an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) scheduled passenger service from Jakarta 
Soekarno-Hatta Airport1 to Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport, Palembang2. 
The co-pilot who occupied left seat was a candidate captain under training was acting as Pilot 
Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) occupied right seat was a training captain 
(instructor) was acting as Pilot Monitoring (PM). 
Prior to the departure from Jakarta, the pilots received a departure briefing consisting of 
weather, flight plan, and notams3. The notams contained significant information for 
Palembang Airport that the parallel taxiway from intersection Alpha to taxiway Bravo were 
closed due to work in progress, The runway 29 Instrument Landing System (ILS) was not in 
service due to the replacement of its localizer antenna. 
When the aircraft entered Palembang’s Controlled Airspace, the crew was instructed to 
descend to 2,500 feet for the VOR/DME approach to runway 29. 
At 00:30 the PIC reported that he had the runway insight after assured the co-pilot that they 
all have seen the runway. The Aerodrome Controller gave the crew the clearance to land. 
The co-pilot was concentrating on instrument scanning during approach by following the 
VOR radial. He wanted to improve his ability to fly manual during an instrument approach. 
The PIC then rechecking whether any item that has been missed prior to land. 
The ATC saw that the aircraft was not on the approach path properly and came close to the 
parallel taxiway. 
At 00:32 the aircraft landed on the parallel taxiway. 
Both pilots were concentrating looking inside and not sufficiently cross checking to the 
outside situation. The aircraft was continuously descend below Minimum Descend Altitude 
(MDA) and landed. 
Pilot monitoring was not sufficiently looked outside to cross-check the flight path to the 
runway. 
There was misalignment of the VOR approach path. 
The controller noticed that the aircraft was not aligned with the runway. 
According to the ATS procedure, the controller could only command the pilot to go around 
whenever the runway is unsafe to land.","['On 2 October 2008, a Boeing Company 737-4K5 aircraft, registered PK-GWT was being operated on an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) scheduled passenger service

116,117, ,KNKT.08.08.12.04,Boeing Company 737-200,27-Aug-08,"Sultan Thaha, Jambi, 
Republic of Indonesia","On 27 August 2008, a Boeing 737-200 aircraft, registered PK-CJG, was being operated on a 
scheduled passenger service from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, Jakarta to Sultan 
Thaha Airport, Jambi with flight number SJY 062. On board on this flight were two pilots, 
four flight attendants, and 124 passengers. 
The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) while the Second in Command (SIC) 
acted as the Pilot Monitoring (PM). 
The flight time from Jakarta to Jambi estimated about one hour and the aircraft was 
dispatched with approximate for 4 hours of fuel endurance. At 09:18 UTC the SIC contacted 
Thaha Tower controller and reported that the aircraft was descending and passing FL160 and 
has been cleared by Palembang Approach control to descend to 12,000 feet. The PIC flew the 
aircraft direct to intercept the final approach runway 31. While descending through 2500 feet 
and about 8 miles from the VOR, the flap one degree and flap 5° were selected. Subsequently 
the landing gear extended and flap 15° was selected. 13 seconds after flap 15 selection, the 
pilots noticed that the hydraulic system A low pressure warning light illuminated, and also the 
hydraulic system A quantity indicator showed zero. The PIC continued the approach and 
adived the SIC that he aimed to fly the aircraft slightly below the normal glide path in order to 
get more distance available for the landing roll. 
The aircraft touched down at 0930 UTC , and during the landing roll the PIC had difficulty to 
select the reversers while applying manual braking. The aircraft drifted to the right of the 
runway centre line about 200 meters prior went out of the runway, stopped at about 120 
meters from the end of the runway 31 on a surface 6 meters below the runway surface. Three 
farmers who were working on that area hit by the aircraft and seriously injured. 
All crew and passengers safely evacuated the aircraft. No significant property damage was 
reported 
The SSCVR and SSFDR were good, examined and subsequently downloaded using the ATSB 
facilities. 
The contributing factors were as the following of: 
The Loss of Hydraulic System A occurred requires the pilots to refere the QRH. At the 
time of occurrence, the pilots has sufficient time to do the procedure and determine all 
the consequences prior to land the aircraft. However the pilot did not use the QRH 
which will assist and guide with the detail of procedures and steps to do before decision 
to land was made, therefore the KNKT recommends that the operator shall ensure that 
pilots when facing the non normal situation should use the QRH and other references 
procedures. 
Crew Resource Management is the application of team management concepts and the 
effective use of all available resources to operate a flight safely and in addition to the 
vi crew, it includes all other groups routinely working with the aircrew are involved in 
decision required to operate a flight. In fact, there was no discussion concerning to the 
non normal situation as described on the CRM before decision to land was made. 
At the time of issuing this final report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi 
(KNKT) has received any safety actions taken by the operator following this serious incident. 
According to factual information, the findings and the contributing factors, on this final report 
the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) issued several safety 
recommendations addressed to PT. Sriwijaya Air and Directorate General of Civil Aviation

At 09:18 UTC the SIC contacted Thaha Tower controller and reported that the aircraft was descending and passing FL160 and has been cleared by Palembang Approach control to descend to 12,000 feet. 13 seconds after flap 15 selection, the pilots noticed that the hydraulic system A low pressure warning light illuminated, and also the hydraulic system A quantity indicator showed zero. The PIC continued the approach and adived the SIC that he aimed to fly the aircraft slightly below the normal glide path in order to get more distance available for the landing roll. No significant property damage was reported The SSCVR and SSFDR were good, examined and subsequently downloaded using the ATSB facilities. However the pilot did not use the QRH which will assist and guide with the detail of procedures and steps to do before decision to land was made, therefore the KNKT recommends that the operator shall ensure that pilots when facing the non normal situation should use the QRH and other references procedures. Crew Resource Management is the application of team management concepts and the effective use of all available resources to operate a flight safely and in addition to the vi crew, it includes all other groups routinely working with the aircrew are involved in decision required to operate a flight. At the time of issuing this final report, the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) has received any safety actions taken by the operator following this serious incident. According to factual information, the findings and the contributing factors, on this final report the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi (KNKT) issued several safety recommendations addressed to PT"

Republic of Indonesia","On the Saturday 9 August 2008, a Pilatus Porter PC-6 B2-H4 aircraft, registered PK RCZ, operated by AMA (Association of Mission Aviation) departed from Taive II for 
NduNdu, Papua, The flight was to be operated in accordance with the visual flight 
rules (VFR), remaining clear of cloud and navigating visually. 
The aircraft did not arrive at NduNdu and pilots of search aircraft reported hearing 
PK-RCZ’s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal, but were unable to reach the 
crash site due to the weather conditions. 
At 2020 (0520 local time on Sunday 10 August), the aircraft wreckage was found at 
an elevation of 6,400 feet at the coordinates 03° 26’ 08” S, 138° 21’ 58” E, in the area 
of NduNdu Pass, on the aircraft’s planned track. The crash site was about 200 feet to 
the left (east) of the southerly track across the Pass, on the slope of an 11,000 foot 
mountain. The coordinates and elevation of the lowest point in the NduNdu Pass were 
03° 26’ 26” S, 138° 21’ 22” E and 5,700 feet. 
The pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured. 
The investigation determined that PK-RCZ departed from Taipe II for NduNdu in 
accordance with the visual flight rules. However, the weather in the NduNdu Pass 
area was reported to have been cloudy. 
The investigation determined that it is likely that the pilot continued flying towards 
the Pass towards the NduNdu aerodrome in instrument meteorological conditions 
(IMC). The aircraft impacted the mountain slope to the east of the Pass while cruising. 
The impact was severe and the accident was not survivable.

The aircraft did not arrive at NduNdu and pilots of search aircraft reported hearing PK-RCZ’s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal, but were unable to reach the crash site due to the weather conditions. At 2020 (0520 local time on Sunday 10 August), the aircraft wreckage was found at an elevation of 6,400 feet at the coordinates 03° 26’ 08” S, 138° 21’ 58” E, in the area of NduNdu Pass, on the aircraft’s planned track. The crash site was about 200 feet to the left (east) of the southerly track across the Pass, on the slope of an 11,000 foot mountain"

Kalimantan 
Republic of Indonesia","On 23 July 2008, a Boeing 737-400 aircraft, registered PK-GZN, was being operated 
on a scheduled passenger service from Soekarno–Hatta Airport, Jakarta to Syamsudin 
Noor Airport, Banjarmasin. There were 121 persons on board; two pilots, five flight 
attendants, and 114 passengers including one child and two infants. 
The pilots reported that the touchdown was normal. When the aircraft slowed to about 
60 knots, the pilot in command (PIC) applied manual braking and shortly after, the 
ANTI SKID INOP light illuminated. The PIC then performed the standard memory 
items of the Emergency Check List, and continued taxiing to the apron. As the PIC 
turned the aircraft to the right to enter taxiway B he heard a sound that he associated 
with a tire bursting, so he stopped the aircraft. 
Engineers who inspected the aircraft on the apron, prior to the passengers 
disembarking, informed the PIC that the number-one main landing gear axle was 
broken, and detached from its strut. The number-two tire had burst. 
None of the aircraft’s occupants were injured, and they disembarked normally using 
airstairs. 
The investigation found that an undetected fatigue crack in the number-one main 
landing gear axle had originated from a corroded hole in the brake assembly 
attachment flange. The fatigue crack propagated toward the flange and the axle wall, 
reaching a length of about 6 cm before a fast final fracture occurred. 
On 5 August 2008, the operator’s maintenance organization issued engineering orders 
that required increased inspection schedules for Boeing 737 main landing gear axles, 
because the axle had failed at a time significantly short of the manufacturer’s 
specified component life. 
On 6 August 2008, the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) issued 
recommendations to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the US Federal 
Aviation Administration, the Boeing Company, and the European Aviation Safety 
Agency, with respect to reviewing the overhaul and inspection requirements for 
Boeing 737 main landing gear axles. 
On 20 July 2009, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) informed the 
NTSC that “Boeing plans to revise the AMM [Aircraft Maintenance Manual] to add 
and highlight the importance of visually inspecting the brake flange location part for 
corrosion and/or damaged Sermetal finish during normal maintenance activities. In 
addition, Summit Aerospace [component overhaul facility] has taken several safety 
enhancement actions by adding a fluorescent penetrant inspection in addition to the 
existing magnetic partial inspection, and revised the relevant magnetic partial 
inspection techniques to enhance the inspection.”","['On 23 July 2008, a Boeing 737-400 aircraft, registered PK-GZN, was being operated on a scheduled passenger service from Soekarno–Hatta Airport,

On 20 July 2009, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) informed the NTSC that “Boeing plans to revise the AMM [Aircraft Maintenance Manual] to add and highlight the importance of visually inspecting the brake flange location part for corrosion and/or damaged Sermetal finish during normal maintenance activities. In addition, Summit Aerospace [component overhaul facility] has taken several safety enhancement actions by adding a fluorescent penetrant inspection in addition to the existing magnetic partial inspection, and revised the relevant magnetic partial inspection techniques to enhance the inspection"

NORTH SUMATERA
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA","On 1 June 2008, an Airbus A320 aircraft, registration PK-YVE, was being 
operated by Metro Batavia Airlines (Batavia Air) flight number 7P-591, on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Jakarta to Medan. The flight departed at 00:10 UTC 
(07:10 local time) with an estimated arrival time at Medan of 02:25. There were 140 
people on board; two pilots, five cabin crew, and 133 passengers. 
The aircraft touched down towards the departure end of the touch-down area of 
runway 05 at Polonia Airport, Medan at 03:04. After a landing run of 41 seconds, the 
aircraft stopped on the runway adjacent to taxiway ‘D’, approximately 1,200 meters 
from the estimated point of touch down. Three main-wheel tires and two main 
wheels were substantially damaged. The aircraft could not be taxied from the runway 
to the apron, nor could it be towed to the apron due to damage to the wheels. 
The passengers and crew disembarked normally at taxiway ‘D’; there were no 
injuries. 
Following an inspection of the landing gear and replacement of the damaged wheels, 
the aircraft was towed to the apron at 10:10. The runway was closed for about 7 
hours. 
The investigation found that the left landing gear down-lock cable was broken. The 
aircraft touched down with the wheel brakes locked due to a hydraulic lock in the 
system, which was the result of an incorrect manual landing gear extension 
procedure being used by the pilots. 
The pilots’ actions indicated that they did not sufficiently understand the aircraft’s 
landing gear system, resulting in them using inappropriate trouble shooting and 
rectification procedures. 
The pilots were not sufficiently confident of the aircraft’s fuel state to conduct a go 
around and fly past as cleared by ATC.
With the release of the final report, the National Transportation Safety Committee’s 
(NTSC) issued two recommendations to address the safety deficiencies identified in 
the report. These covered flight crew technical knowledge of aircraft systems, fuel 
planning and flight management, and the regulatory oversight of the airline’s training

Republic of Indonesia","On 18 April 2008, at 1115 UTC, a Boeing B737-300 aircraft, registered PK CJC operated by PT. Sriwijaya Air, was being flown on a scheduled flight from 
Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang. During the landing at Pangkal Pinang, the aircraft overran 
the end of the runway. The aircraft stopped 50 meters beyond the end of the runway, 
but within the stop-way. 
There were 150 people on board; two pilots, four flight attendants, and 144 
passengers. The aircraft’s occupants were not injured, and disembarked normally 
using air stairs one hour after the aircraft stopped. Based upon crew interviewed, 
airport fire and rescue personnel arrived at the aircraft approximately 10 minutes after 
it stopped. During that 10 minute period, the flight crew were not aware of the extent 
of the damage to the aircraft and if a fire may have started. 
The PIC became distracted by a cabin issue during the approach, and did not 
appropriately monitor the aircraft’s approach profile. The investigation found that the 
aircraft was high and fast on the approach, but the pilot in command allowed the co 
pilot to continue the approach and landing. 
The investigation determined that the approach was un-stabilized, and the flight 
crew’s compliance with procedures, including crew resource management, was not at 
a level to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee issued several recommendations to 
the aircraft operator and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation with the final 
report. These included: a review of airline procedures and flight crew training with 
respect to the timeliness of evacuation of passengers and crew after an accident or 
serious incident, particularly when the extent of damage to the aircraft is not known; a 
review of training programs and procedures with respect to stabilized approaches; and 
the promulgation of procedures requiring flight crew and maintenance personnel to 
deactivate the power source to flight recorders as soon as practicable after an accident 
or serious incident. The NTSC also urged the DGCA to ensure that Indonesian 
operators have flight recorder deactivation procedures and they are implemented. 
The NTSC also reiterated its recommendations that were previously issued to the 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation with Report KNKT.07.11.27.04 stressing 
similar safety concerns.

Republic of Indonesia","On 6 March 2008, a Transall C-160 aircraft, registered PK-VTQ, 
operated by PT. Manunggal Air, was on an unscheduled freight flight 
from Sentani Airport, Jayapura, to Wamena Airport, Papua. There were 
six people on board; two pilots, one flight engineer, one AME (Aircraft 
Maintenance Engineer), one Mechanic, one FOO (Flight Operation 
Officer). 
The Beta lights did not illuminate during the landing roll at Wamena, so 
reverse thrust could not be used. The pilots used maximum brake action 
to slow the aircraft, and rolled through to the end of runway 15, then 
backtracked the aircraft towards taxiway “E”, about 450 meters from the 
departure end of runway 15. 
The air traffic controller informed the Transall crew that heavy smoke 
was coming from the left main-wheels, and activated the crash alarm. The 
pilots stopped the aircraft on taxiway “E”, and the occupants disembarked 
and attempted to extinguish the wheel-bay fire with a hand held 
extinguisher. 
The airport rescue fire fighting service (RFFS) took 15 minutes to 
commence applying foam to the fire. The attempts to extinguish the fire 
were unsuccessful, and the fire destroyed the aircraft and its cargo of fuel 
in drums. 
The investigation determined that the left main wheels’ brakes overheated 
during the landing roll. Due to the extreme fire damage, the investigation 
was not able to determine the condition of the brake pads at the time of 
the landing, and if that may have contributed to the overheating. 
A fire commenced in the brake area of one or more of the left main 
landing gear wheels. Sections of the left aft main wheels’, inner and outer 
brake disks were substantially damaged, with sections missing; burnt 
away. The investigation was unable to determine the location of the 
source of the fire propellant. It is likely that brake system hydraulic fluid 
under pressure, was the propellant that fed the fire. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee’s report includes 
recommendations to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to address 
safety deficiencies to ensure compliance with ICAO Annex 14 
Standards. The safety deficiencies are with respect to the status of the 
RFFS equipment at Wamena, and the need to establish and exercise an 
Emergency Response Plan for Wamena.

Republic of Indonesia","On the morning of 30 January 2008, a de Havilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft, 
registered PK-BRP, was being operated by PT. Aviastar Mandiri Airlines on a charter 
flight carrying passengers and cargo from Nabire to Sugapa, via Enarotali, Papua. 
There were 18 persons on board; two pilots, one engineer, and 15 passengers. The 
pilot in command (PIC) was the handling pilot, and the co-pilot was the 
monitoring/support pilot. 
Sugapa weather was clear, with the surface wind calm. The PIC made the approach to 
runway 27 at Sugapa. 
Shortly after touchdown, the aircraft veered to the left and the PIC was unable to 
maintain directional control to keep the aircraft on the runway. The aircraft left the 
runway and struck and fatally injured a man standing close to the edge of the runway. 
The right main wheel sank into soft ground and the aircraft swung abruptly to the 
right through 270 degrees, tearing the nose landing gear from the aircraft. It stopped 
with the nose embedded in an embankment 5 meters from the side of the runway. 
The aircraft was substantially damaged, but the occupants were not injured and 
vacated the aircraft unaided. 
The pilot in command indicated that the aircraft had a history of a tendency to veer to 
left during ground roll. However, investigation found no pre-landing defects with the 
aircraft that could have contributed to the accident. There was also no record of such a 
defect being entered in the aircraft maintenance log. 
The investigation found that the nose landing gear fork cracked and was deformed as 
a result of being subjected to a high impact force during the touchdown. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee made recommendations to PT.

Aviastar Mandiri Airlines on a charter flight carrying passengers and cargo from Nabire to Sugapa, via Enarotali, Papua. Shortly after touchdown, the aircraft veered to the left and the PIC was unable to maintain directional control to keep the aircraft on the runway. The right main wheel sank into soft ground and the aircraft swung abruptly to the right through 270 degrees, tearing the nose landing gear from the aircraft. However, investigation found no pre-landing defects with the aircraft that could have contributed to the accident. The investigation found that the nose landing gear fork cracked and was deformed as a result of being subjected to a high impact force during the touchdown. Aviastar Mandiri Airlines and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation with respect to procedures for flight crew to document aircraft and system defects in the aircraft maintenance log"

PAPUA
Republic of Indonesia","On 28 January 2008, a Boeing B737-300 aircraft, registered PK-MBP, operated 
by PT. Merpati Nusantara Airline, departed from Sentani Airport, Jayapura, 
Papua, to Mopah Airport Merauke. 
The Merauke air traffic controller reported that when the aircraft was on final 
approach there were no obstructions on the runway, so he cleared the aircraft to 
land on runway 16. 
During the landing roll, the pilot observed that a cow had entered the active 
runway and was running across the runway in front of the aircraft. When the 
aircraft was about 1,000 meters from the runway 16 threshold, the left engine 
struck the cow. The pilots stopped the aircraft on the runway and shut down the 
left engine. The cabin crew informed the pilots that left engine cowling was 
damaged. 
The aircraft’s occupants were not injured, and disembarked from the aircraft 
unaided, using air stairs at the apron. 
The investigation found that the airport did not meet the requirements of ICAO 
Annex 14, Volume 1, Paragraph 9.10.2, Standard, or the intent of Civil Aviation 
Safety Regulation (CASR) 139 Subparts 4.2 and 4.12. 
The airport perimeter was not fenced, and there was no other appropriate means 
of preventing animals, large enough to be a hazard to aircraft from entering the 
aircraft movement area of the airport. 
The cockpit voice recorder was unserviceable and no useful information was 
recorded during the accident flight. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee made recommendations to the 
Directorate General of Civil Aviation to require airport operators to control 
access and prevent unauthorised entry of persons, vehicles, equipment or animals, 
or other things that may endanger aircraft safety, onto the movement area of all 
Indonesian airports.

East Kalimantan
Republic of Indonesia","On 26 January 2008, a Casa 212-200 aircraft, registered PK-VSE, was being 
operated by PT. Dirgantara Air Service as a cargo charter flight from Tarakan 
Airport to Long Apung Airport. There were three persons on board; two pilots 
and one aircraft maintenance engineer/load master. The aircraft was certified 
as being airworthy prior to departure. 
The aircraft departed from Tarakan at 0011 UTC (08:11 local time), and the 
estimated time arrival at Long Apung was 0136. At 0411 the pilot of another 
aircraft received a distress signal and informed air traffic services at Tarakan. 
Searchers subsequently found the aircraft wreckage at an elevation of 2,766 
feet, about 3.4 NM from Long Apung Airport. The coordinates of the accident 
site were 01° 39.483′ S and 115° 00.265′ E near Lidung Payau Village, 
Malinau, East Kalimantan. The accident site was on the left downwind leg of 
the runway 35 circuit. 
Witnesses reported that at the time of the occurrence the downwind leg of the 
circuit for Runway 35 at Long Apung Airport was obscured by low cloud. 
The copilot twice warned the PIC “be careful sir, there is a hill”. It is likely 
that the pilots were unable to keep the runway in sight during the maneuvering 
on downwind for runway 35. 
The investigation determined that it is likely that the pilots did not maintain 
visual flight procedures, and flew the aircraft into instrument meteorological 
conditions prior to colliding with the terrain. 
As a result of this investigation, the National Transportation Safety Committee 
issued recommendations to address safety issues identified in this report. 
Specifically with respect to the operators pilot training and checking, to ensure 
that it covers the use of the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) (or similar) 
Approach-and-landing Accident Reduction (ALAR) and Controlled Flight Into 
Terrain (CFIT) awareness training material.

A pre-flight check was conducted before takeoff, and no damage or abnormalities were found. The aircraft began its flight at 7:45 AM local time and commenced the fertilizer spreading operation. The loading of fertilizer into the aircraft during the first to the tenth flights proceeded without any issues.

However, during the loading for the eleventh flight, the aircraft took off and experienced an accident at 9:30 AM in the K19 L20 block area. Shortly after the accident, staff from the agronomy/plantation department reported the incident to the technicians in the hangar.

As the aircraft was heading to the fertilization point in the H-20 area and maneuvering at very low altitude, the left wing of the aircraft struck the oil palm trees. This resulted in the left wing breaking and subsequently causing the aircraft to crash.

However, during the loading for the eleventh flight, the aircraft took off and experienced an accident at 9:30 AM in the K19 L20 block area. As the aircraft was heading to the fertilization point in the H-20 area and maneuvering at very low altitude, the left wing of the aircraft struck the oil palm trees"

Central Sulawesi
Republic of Indonesia ","On Friday 7 December 2007, a Piper Seneca PA-34 aircraft, registration PK-JKS, was being 
operated by PT. Air Transport Service (ATS) on a flight from Makassar to Kasiguncu 
Airport, Poso City, Central Sulawesi. The aircraft departed from Makassar at 00:45 
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and arrived at Kasiguncu at 01:55. There were 6 
occupants; 1 pilot and 5 passengers. 
During the landing on runway 21, the aircraft travelled normally for about 200 meters and 
then suddenly diverged left causing the propeller to strike the runway. Numerous slash marks 
from the three-bladed propeller were found for a distance of 100 meters on the runway. The 
left wing subsequently struck the runway, causing the aircraft to continue turning left through 
90 degrees. The aircraft stopped on the grass shoulder of runway 21. 
The airport’s rescue fire fighting vehicle had been unserviceable since it was damaged during 
riots in 2004. Airport personnel went immediately to the accident site to offer assistance and 
brought portable fire fighting equipment. There was no fire. The pilot and his 5 passengers 
were uninjured. 
The investigation determined that there was no evidence of any defect with the landing gear 
micro switches, or hydraulic system. The investigation was not able to conclusively determine 
the reason the landing gear unlocked and subsequently retracted. 
The NTSC made recommendations to the Kasiguncu Airport operator and the Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation covering the airport emergency equipment, planning and response 
at Kasiguncu Airport.","['On Friday 7 December 2007, a Piper Seneca PA-34 aircraft, registration PK-JKS, was being operated by PT', 'Air Transport Service (ATS) on a flight from Makassar to Kasiguncu

129,130, ,KNKT.07.11.31.04,Cessna 172M,16-Nov-07,"42 NM north west of Depati Amir Airport, 
Pangkal Pinang
Republic of Indonesia","On 16 November 2007, a Cessna 172 aircraft operated by Admal SDN. 
BHD Malaysia, registered 9M-BDI, departed from Hang Nadim Airport, 
Batam, on a ferry flight to Pangkal Pinang (Depati Amir) Airport, Indonesia. 
There were two persons on board. The flight had originated at Subang 
Airport, Selangor, Malaysia and tracked via Johor Bahru and Batam, landing 
at each airport, but only refueling at Batam. 
About an hour after departure from Batam, the pilot reported climbing above 
1,500 feet, and 3 minutes later the pilot broadcast a MAYDAY, stating that 
he was looking for a place to land. At that time he reported that he was 49 
miles from Pangkal Pinang and passing 7,500 feet. The pilot did not give a 
reason for the Mayday broadcast until 5 minutes later. He said that he had 
found a place to land, and then made a passing reference to a fuel leak, and 
that he would refuel and take off from the landing position. The aircraft was 
carrying three jerry cans of avgas in the passenger cabin. 
The pilot subsequently landed on a beach 42 NM north west of Pangkal 
Pinang. During the landing roll the nose wheel sank into soft sand and 
collapsed, resulting in the aircraft overturning. 
The pilot’s passing reference to refuelling and taking off from the forced 
landing position, indicated that following the forced landing he intended to 
refuel from the on-board jerry cans of avgas, and take off from the beach. It 
was evident that the pilot knew that the engine had failed due to fuel 
exhaustion. 
The pilot informed the investigators that he had not leaned the fuel mixture 
during the climb to, and subsequent cruise at 9,000 feet. The investigation 
determined that the pilot did not operate the aircraft in accordance with the 
engine leaning procedures specified by the operator and the aircraft 
manufacturer. If the pilot had used the same procedures for the flight sectors 
from Subang to Johore Bahru and Batam, it is likely that after refueling at 
Batam there was considerably less fuel in the aircraft’s wing tanks than 
estimated by the pilot. 
The investigation determined that under the operating procedures used by the 
pilot, the aircraft did not have sufficient useable fuel on board to complete 
the planned flight when it departed from Batam. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee issued recommendations to 
the operator, Admal Sdn. Bhd. Malaysia, and the Malaysian Department of 
Civil Aviation. The recommendations seek to ensure that appropriate 
guidance documentation, training, and supervision are provided in the areas 
of engine handling/fuel management procedures; the carriage of avgas and 
other dangerous goods in the passenger cabin when carrying passengers; and 
filing of flight plans and other required documents.","['On 16 November 2007, a Cessna 172 aircraft operated by Admal SDN', 'BHD Malaysia, registered 9M-BDI, departed from Hang Nadim Airport, Batam,

The flight had originated at Subang Airport, Selangor, Malaysia and tracked via Johor Bahru and Batam, landing at each airport, but only refueling at Batam. About an hour after departure from Batam, the pilot reported climbing above 1,500 feet, and 3 minutes later the pilot broadcast a MAYDAY, stating that he was looking for a place to land. He said that he had found a place to land, and then made a passing reference to a fuel leak, and that he would refuel and take off from the landing position. The pilot’s passing reference to refuelling and taking off from the forced landing position, indicated that following the forced landing he intended to refuel from the on-board jerry cans of avgas, and take off from the beach. If the pilot had used the same procedures for the flight sectors from Subang to Johore Bahru and Batam, it is likely that after refueling at Batam there was considerably less fuel in the aircraft’s wing tanks than estimated by the pilot. The investigation determined that under the operating procedures used by the pilot, the aircraft did not have sufficient useable fuel on board to complete the planned flight when it departed from Batam. The recommendations seek to ensure that appropriate guidance documentation, training, and supervision are provided in the areas of engine handling/fuel management procedures; the carriage of avgas and other dangerous goods in the passenger cabin when carrying passengers; and filing of flight plans and other required documents"

MALANG
EAST JAVA
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA","On the afternoon of 1 November 2007, a Boeing Company B737-200 aircraft, 
registered PK-RIL, operated by PT. Mandala Airlines as flight number MDL 260, 
on a scheduled passenger flight from Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, 
Jakarta, was substantially damaged as a result of a severe hard landing sequence at 
Abdurrachman Saleh Airport, Malang, East Java. There were 94 persons on board 
the aircraft, consisting of two pilots, three cabin crew, and 89 passengers. 
The investigation determined that the crew did not refer to the aircraft rate of 
descent when it exceeded 1,000 feet/minute during the landing approach, and was 
therefore an unstabilized approach condition. 
The investigation also determined that the PIC did not respond appropriately to the 
any of ground proximity warning system voice ‘aural warnings that were initiated 
during the latter stages of the approach as a result of the high rate of descent of the 
aircraft. 
The derived FDR data revealed that the aircraft bounced to a height of about 20 
feet after the initial severe hard landing. However, there was no attempt by the 
crew to recover from the high bounce by initiating a go-around. On 2 December 2009, Mandala Airlines informed the NTSC that its safety action 
included issuing a Safety Quality Notice to all pilots stressing required procedures 
for stabilized approach in IMC and VMC. The SQN reinforced previous SQNs 
issued in November 2007 and September 2008, and a 10 November 2007 Mandala 
safety news letter article. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee’s (NTSC) report includes 
recommendations to PT. Mandala Airlines and the Directorate General of Civil 
Aviation to address safety deficiencies relating to flight crew training for the 
prevention of unstabilized approaches.","['On the afternoon of 1 November 2007, a Boeing Company B737-200 aircraft, registered PK-RIL, operated by PT', 'Mandala Airlines as flight number MDL 260, on a

Nusantara Airlines as a flight number MZ 7976, departed from Ambon, Langgur than to 
Dobo the aircraft was airworthy prior departure.
In flight from Langgur to Dobo, the Co-pilot acted as flying pilot. 
During the final approach at Dobo, while aircraft speed approximately 90 knots, the aircraft 
had a sudden bump, the co-pilot tried to correct the situation by pushed the control column 
and simultaneously reduced the power lever. At about 100 feet of altitude, the PIC called out 
“EH – EH – EH, I HAVE CONTROL”. The PIC decided to go around and open power. 
During the go around the aircraft touch the ground on the grass covered area, about 38 meters 
before the beginning of runway 05 and rolled about 8 meters. The area was covered by grass 
up to 60 centimeters tall. During this ground roll, the left main landing gear impacted to the 
mound about 25 centimeters high. 
The aircraft successfully go around and landed using runway 23, touched down about 130 
meters from beginning of runway, on centre line and veered to the left of centerline. The PIC 
managed to correct and the aircraft returned to centerline.

Republic of Indonesia","On Friday 1 June 2007, a de Havilland Twin Otter DHC 6-300, registered PK-YRU 
overran the right side of the runway during the take-off roll. The aircraft left the runway 
and impacted a ditch and rocks on the right shoulder of the runway. Main-wheel tire marks 
for more than 65 meters on the runway indicated that heavy braking action was being 
applied to the left brake. 
A witness statement confirmed the tire track evidence on the runway, that during the early 
take-off roll the aircraft turned right, then left, and then back to the right before leaving the 
runway. The aircraft was substantially damaged. None of the occupants were injured. 
The handling pilot was undergoing captaincy training under the supervision of an 
instructor.
The investigation was unable to determine why the aircraft commenced veering to the right 
during the early acceleration phase of the takeoff. The pilots continued the takeoff and 
directional control was lost during the take-off roll. The instructor pilot was unable to 
regain directional control of the aircraft before it left the runway.
No aircraft or system defect was found that could have contributed to the pilots’ inability 
to maintain directional control during the take-off roll. 
The pilot under training stated that “things happened fast” and he was “unaware that the 
power levers were still in the full on position”, but was “conscious that his left hand was 
on the steering handle”. He said that he did not immediately respond to a shout from the 
instructor to not use the steering handle. 
The investigation considered that it was possible that the nose-wheel steering was not 
centred before commencing the take-off roll and that the pilot under training may have 
been unaware that he was holding an inappropriate nose-wheel steering position during the 
take-off roll. 
The National Transportation Safety Committee made a recommendation to the Directorate 
General of Civil Aviation to review the safety of the Mulia runway shoulder area and 
require the airport operator to ensure that there are no obstacles to safety, such as ditches 
and rocks, to prevent an aircraft from safely negotiating the runway shoulder in the event 
of a runway excursion.

Main-wheel tire marks for more than 65 meters on the runway indicated that heavy braking action was being applied to the left brake. A witness statement confirmed the tire track evidence on the runway, that during the early take-off roll the aircraft turned right, then left, and then back to the right before leaving the runway. The pilot under training stated that “things happened fast” and he was “unaware that the power levers were still in the full on position”, but was “conscious that his left hand was on the steering handle”. The investigation considered that it was possible that the nose-wheel steering was not centred before commencing the take-off roll and that the pilot under training may have been unaware that he was holding an inappropriate nose-wheel steering position during the take-off roll. The National Transportation Safety Committee made a recommendation to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to review the safety of the Mulia runway shoulder area and require the airport operator to ensure that there are no obstacles to safety, such as ditches and rocks, to prevent an aircraft from safely negotiating the runway shoulder in the event of a runway excursion"

Indonesia AirAsia on a scheduled passenger flight with flight number QZ 7506 was 
scheduled from the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (WIII) Jakarta, Indonesia to the 
Polonia Airport (WIMM) of Medan, Indonesia. On board of this flight were two pilots, three 
flight attendants, and 129 passengers. The Second in Command acted as Pilot Flying while 
the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring. 
The flight until commenced approach was uneventful. The PIC noticed that the approach 
speed was high and at 500 feet decided to take over the control and land the aircraft. The 
pilot felt that the touchdown was positive and the aircraft continued exit runway via taxiway 
B. During taxi, the pilot felt vibration on the nose wheel steering. The aircraft parked at bay 
number 5 and the passengers disembarked normally. No one injured in this accident.
The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) recorded that during touchdown the indicated airspeed was 
190 knots while the target landing speed was approximately 130 knots and the vertical 
acceleration was 4.8 g.
During turn around check found 14 tie bolts of the left nose wheel detached which one of the 
tie bolt could not be found, the left nose wheel tire deflated. Fuselage skin above the nose 
wheel wrinkled and deformation was also found on this section. The left main landing gear 
bearing and axle were found to be damaged.","['On 25 May 2007, a Boeing 737-300 aircraft, registered PK-AWP was being operated by PT', 'Indonesia AirAsia on a scheduled passenger flight with flight

climbed to 200 feet and turned to right to the next target on line no. 9. While passed 150
feet, the pilot felt the aircraft lost its power and altitude. The pilot pushed the throttle to full
to recover the aircraft power and altitude.
During recovering climb, the aircraft could not avoid bamboo tree clusters. The aircraft
struck into bamboo trees and lost its control than crashed at the bamboo cluster area>
The pilot was suffered minor injuries, and the aircraft was major damage.
The plantation surfaces generally flat, however, in some places, there were a river using for
irrigation, tobacco and others plant as bamboo, oil palm, and teak. In this area, has a

The higher group of plantation might built turbulence when the strong wind blown
through. At the time the accident, the witness who is an aircraft maintenance engineer informed that

During return flight to Halim Perdanakusuma Airport, Jakarta, the aircraft was lost its power and then the engine was in an idle rpm. During investigation, the carburettor found the rod end, nut and split pin were not attached in the throttle arm, indicated the engine was uncontrolled. The Alfa Flying School had been conducted an inspection to ensure proper installation for all the aircraft related to the carburettor rod end, nut and split pin attachment in the throttle arm"
137,138, ,KNKT/07.06/07.02.35,BOEING 737–497,7-Mar-07,"ADI SUCIPTO AIRPORT, YOGYAKARTA
INDONESIA","On 7 March 2007, a Boeing Company 737-497 aircraft, registered PK-GZC, was 
being operated by Garuda Indonesia on an instrument flight rules (IFR), scheduled 
passenger service, as flight number GA200 from Soekarno-Hatta Airport, Jakarta to 
Adi Sucipto Airport, Yogyakarta. There were two pilots, five flight attendants, and 
133 passengers on board. 
The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 
at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. Yogya Approach cleared the 
aircraft for a visual approach, with a requirement to proceed to long final and report 
runway in sight. Although the crew acknowledged the visual approach clearance, they 
continued with the ILS approach, but did not inform the controller. The descent and 
approach were conducted in visual meteorological conditions. 
At 23:55:33, when the aircraft was 10.1 miles from the runway, it was 1,427 feet 
above the initial fix of 2,500 feet published in the approach chart, and the airspeed was 
283 knots. The pilot in command descended the aircraft steeply in an attempt to reach 
the runway, but in doing so, the airspeed increased excessively. Because the aircraft 
was being flown at speeds that were in excess of the wing flaps operation speed, the 
copilot elected not to extend the flaps as instructed by the PIC. During the approach, 
the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times 
and the copilot called for the PIC to go around. 
The PIC continued the approach with flaps 5 degrees, and the aircraft attained the 
glideslope near the runway 09 threshold. Flaps 5 degrees is not a landing flap setting. 
The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 
knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The wind 
was north easterly at 9 knots. The groundspeed was 235 knots. The aircraft touched 
down at an airspeed of 221 knots, 87 knots faster than landing speed for 40 degrees 
flap. Shortly after touching down, the copilot called, with high intonation, for the PIC 
to go around. 
The aircraft was flown at an excessive airspeed and steep flight path angle during the 
approach and landing, resulting in an unstabilized approach. The PIC did not follow 
company procedures that required him to fly a stabilized approach, and he did not 
abort the landing and go around when the approach was not stabilized.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviationâ€™s flying operations surveillance of Garuda was 
not effective in identifying these and other safety deficiencies. 
The Yogyakarta Airportâ€™s rescue and fire fighting services vehicles were unable to reach 
the accident site and some did not have appropriate fire suppressant. The delay in 
extinguishing the fire, and the lack of appropriate fire suppressant agents, may have 
significantly reduced survivability. The airport emergency plan and its implementation 
were less than effective. 

A number of safety actions by Angkasa Pura I to address safety deficiencies with respect to 
airport emergency preparedness and associated services and equipment are also included. 
Since the accident, an access road between the airport perimeter and the area of the 
accident site has been constructed. 
On 2 April 2007, Garuda issued a notice to its pilots reinforcing its mandatory policy 
relating to a pilot monitoring to take control of an aircraft and execute a go around in 
instances of unstabilized approach, when the pilot flying does not make an appropriate 
response. The notice assures pilots that the company will not take disciplinary measures for 
a go around executed under any unsafe or unstabilized approach.

The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times and the copilot called for the PIC to go around. The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The PIC did not follow company procedures that required him to fly a stabilized approach, and he did not abort the landing and go around when the approach was not stabilized. The Yogyakarta Airportâ€™s rescue and fire fighting services vehicles were unable to reach the accident site and some did not have appropriate fire suppressant. A number of safety actions by Angkasa Pura I to address safety deficiencies with respect to airport emergency preparedness and associated services and equipment are also included. On 2 April 2007, Garuda issued a notice to its pilots reinforcing its mandatory policy relating to a pilot monitoring to take control of an aircraft and execute a go around in instances of unstabilized approach, when the pilot flying does not make an appropriate response. The notice assures pilots that the company will not take disciplinary measures for a go around executed under any unsafe or unstabilized approach"

Aviastar Mandiri Pty Ltd, was on a charter flight from Balikpapan, East Kalimantan 
to Tanjung Bara, East Kalimantan. 
The aircraft departed from Balikpapan at 23:00 with a planned flight time of 55 
minutes at an altitude of 7000 feet. There were 13 people on board; two pilots, a 
maintenance engineer, and 10 passengers. The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot 
flying for the sector to Tanjung Bara, and the copilot was the monitoring/support 
pilot. 
The flight was normal until 5 minutes before landing when the number-1 (left engine) 
generator malfunctioned. The pilot in command (PIC) asked the maintenance engineer 
(on board the aircraft), who advised that there was no problem for the aircraft 
operations. 
The aircraft made its final approach to runway 04 at Tanjung Bara at 23:50. The 
aircraft touched down to the right of the centreline, then diverged right into soft wet 
ground, impacting a channel embankment and subsequently a barbed-wire airport 
perimeter fence. 
The investigation determined that aircraft was not being flown on a stabilized 
approach and subsequently touched down to the right of the runway centerline. It then 
veered to the right of centerline after touchdown and the PICs effort to bring the 
aircraft back to the runway centreline by using aileron was ineffective. 
There was no evidence that visibility affecting visual acquisition of the runway was a 
factor. However, the investigation considered that a visual approach guidance system 
such as Visual Approach System Indication (VASI), may have provided additional 
visual cues to alert the pilots to the prevent the unstabilized approach.","['On 11 January 2007, a Casa 212-200 aircraft registered PK-BRM, operated by PT', 'Aviastar Mandiri Pty Ltd, was on a

The aircraft touched down to the right of the centreline, then diverged right into soft wet ground, impacting a channel embankment and subsequently a barbed-wire airport perimeter fence. It then veered to the right of centerline after touchdown and the PICs effort to bring the aircraft back to the runway centreline by using aileron was ineffective.

REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA","On 1 January 2007, a Boeing Company 737-4Q8 aircraft, registered PK-KKW, operated by 
Adam SkyConnection Airlines (AdamAir) as flight number DHI 574, was on a 
scheduled passenger flight from Surabaya (SUB), East Java to Manado (MDC), Sulawesi, 
at FL 350 (35,000 feet) when it disappeared from radar. 
The aircraft departed from Djuanda Airport, Surabaya at 05:59 Coordinated Universal Time 
(UTC) under the instrument flight rules (IFR), with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) at 
Sam Ratulangi Airport, Manado of 08:14. The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying 
for the sector to Manado and the copilot was the monitoring/support pilot. There were 102 
people on board; two pilots, 4 cabin crew, and 96 passengers comprised of 85 adults, 7 
children and 4 infants. 
The Indonesian Navy, Army, Air Force, Police, and Search and Rescue organization, a 
Singaporean Air Force Fokker 50 aircraft, the USNS Mary Sears, National Transportation 
Safety Committee of Indonesia, Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore, 
Singapore Navy Divers, and other resources searched for the wreckage of PK-KKW in the 
Makassar Strait, in the vicinity of the last radar return. 
Nine days after the aircraft disappeared, wreckage was found in the water and on the shore 
along the coast near Pare-Pare, Sulawesi. Locator beacon signals from the flight recorders 
were heard on 21 January 2007 and their positions logged. The attempt to recover the 
recorders was suspended when it was determined that the wreckage was located in the 
ocean at a depth of about 2,000 meters, requiring specialized recovery equipment not 
available in the Region. The DFDR data showed that roll rate was momentarily arrested several times, but there was 
only one significant attempt to arrest the roll. Positive and sustained roll attitude recovery 
was not achieved. Even after the aircraft had reached a bank angle of 100 degrees, with the 
pitch attitude approaching 60 degrees aircraft nose down, the pilot did not roll the aircraftâ€™s 
wings level before attempting pitch recovery in accordance with standard operating 
procedures. The aircraft reached 3.5g, as the speed reached Mach 0.926 during sustained 
nose-up elevator control input while still in a right bank. The recorded airspeed exceeded 
Vdive (400 kcas), and reached a maximum of approximately 490 kcas just prior to the end 
of recording. A thump, thump sound was evident on the CVR about 20 seconds from the end of the 
recorded data. Flight recorder data indicated that a significant structural failure occurred 
when the aircraft was at a speed of Mach 0.926 and the flight load suddenly and rapidly 
reversed from 3.5g to negative 2.8 g. This g force and airspeed are beyond the design 
limitations of the aircraft. At the time of the thump, thump sound, the aircraft was in a 
critically uncontrollable state. 
The PIC did not manage task sharing and crew resource management practices were not 
followed. There was no evidence that the pilots were appropriately controlling the aircraft, 
even after the BANK ANGLE alert sounded as the aircraftâ€™s roll exceeded 35 degrees right 
bank. 
This accident resulted from a combination of factors, including the failure of the pilots to 
adequately monitor the flight instruments, particularly during the final 2 minutes of the 
flight. Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System (IRS) diverted 
both pilotsâ€™ attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and 
bank angle to go unnoticed. The pilots did not detect and appropriately arrest the descent 
soon enough to prevent loss of control.

The aircraft departed from Djuanda Airport, Surabaya at 05:59 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) under the instrument flight rules (IFR), with an estimated time of arrival (ETA) at Sam Ratulangi Airport, Manado of 08:14. There were 102 people on board; two pilots, 4 cabin crew, and 96 passengers comprised of 85 adults, 7 children and 4 infants. The Indonesian Navy, Army, Air Force, Police, and Search and Rescue organization, a Singaporean Air Force Fokker 50 aircraft, the USNS Mary Sears, National Transportation Safety Committee of Indonesia, Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore, Singapore Navy Divers, and other resources searched for the wreckage of PK-KKW in the Makassar Strait, in the vicinity of the last radar return. The attempt to recover the recorders was suspended when it was determined that the wreckage was located in the ocean at a depth of about 2,000 meters, requiring specialized recovery equipment not available in the Region. The DFDR data showed that roll rate was momentarily arrested several times, but there was only one significant attempt to arrest the roll. Even after the aircraft had reached a bank angle of 100 degrees, with the pitch attitude approaching 60 degrees aircraft nose down, the pilot did not roll the aircraftâ€™s wings level before attempting pitch recovery in accordance with standard operating procedures. There was no evidence that the pilots were appropriately controlling the aircraft, even after the BANK ANGLE alert sounded as the aircraftâ€™s roll exceeded 35 degrees right bank. Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System (IRS) diverted both pilotsâ€™ attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and bank angle to go unnoticed"
